\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

The binary trees introduced so far store information in nodes. It's
possible to store the information in edges.
Trie and Patricia are important data structures in
information retrieving and manipulating.
They were invented in 1960s. And are widely used in
compiler design\cite{okasaki-int-map}, and bio-information area, such as
DNA pattern matching \cite{wiki-suffix-tree}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/radix-tree.ps}
  \caption{Radix tree.} \label{fig:radix-tree}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:radix-tree} shows a radix tree\cite{CLRS}. It contains the
strings of bit 1011, 10, 011, 100 and 0. When searching a key $k=(b_0b_1...b_n)_2$, we
take the first bit $b_0$ (MSB from left), check if it is 0 or 1, if it
is 0, we turn left; and turn right for 1. Then we take the second bit and
repeat this search till either meet a leaf or finish all n bits.

The radix tree needn't store keys in node at all. The
information is represented by edges. The nodes marked with keys
in the above figure are only for illustration purpose.

It is very natural to come to the idea `is it possible to represent
key in integer instead of string?' Because integer can be written in
binary format, such approach can save spaces. Another advantage is
that the speed is fast because we can use bit-wise manipulation in
most programming environment.

\section{Integer Trie}
\label{int-trie}

The data structure shown in figure \ref{fig:radix-tree} is
called as \emph{binary trie}.
Trie is invented by Edward Fredkin. It comes from ``retrieval'', pronounce
as /'tri:/ by the inventor, while it is pronounced /'trai/ ``try''
by other authors \cite{wiki-trie}. Trie is also called prefix tree or
radix tree.
A binary
trie is a special binary tree in which the placement of each key is controlled by
its bits, each 0 means ``go left'' and each 1 means ``go
right''\cite{okasaki-int-map}.

Because integers can be represented in binary format, it is
possible to store integer keys rather than 0, 1 strings. When insert an
integer as the new key to the trie, we change it to binary form, then examine
the first bit, if it is 0, we recursively
insert the rest bits to the left sub tree; otherwise if it is 1, we insert
into the right sub tree.

There is a problem when treat the key as integer. Consider a binary
trie shown in figure \ref{fig:big-endian-trie}. If represented in
0, 1 strings, all the three keys are different. But they are identical when
turn into integers. Where should we insert decimal 3, for example, to the trie?

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/big-endian-trie.ps}
  \caption{a big-endian trie} \label{fig:big-endian-trie}
\end{figure}

One approach is to treat all the prefix zero as effective bits.
Suppose the integer is represented with 32-bits, If we want to insert key 1,
it ends up with a tree of 32 levels.
There are 31 nodes, each only has the left sub tree. the last node only has
the right sub tree. It is very inefficient in terms of space.

Okasaki shows a method to solve this problem in \cite{okasaki-int-map}. Instead of
using big-endian integer, we can use the little-endian integer to represent key.
Thus decimal integer 1 is represented as binary 1. Insert it to the empty binary
trie, the result is a trie with a root and a right leaf.
There is only 1 level. decimal 2 is represented as 01, and decimal 3 is $(11)_2$
in little-eidan binary format. There is no need to add
any prefix 0, the position in the trie is uniquely determined.

%=========================================================================
%       Definition of integer trie
%=========================================================================
\subsection{Definition of integer Trie}
In order to define the little-endian binary trie, we can reuse the structure
of binary tree.
A binary trie node is either empty, or a branch node. The branch
node contains a left child, a right node, and optional value as
satellite data.
The left sub tree is encoded as 0 and the right sub tree
is encoded as 1.

The following example Haskell code defines the trie algebraic data type.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
data IntTrie a = Empty
               | Branch (IntTrie a) (Maybe a) (IntTrie a)
\end{lstlisting}

Below is another example definition in Python.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
class IntTrie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.left = self.right = None
        self.value = None
\end{lstlisting}


% ================================================================
%               Insertion of integer trie
% ================================================================
\subsection{Insertion}

Since the key is little-endian integer, when insert a key, we take the
bit one by one from the right most (LSB).
If it is 0, we go to the left, otherwise go to the right
for 1. If the child is empty, we need create a new node, and repeat this to
the last bit (MSB) of the key.

%\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{Insert}{$T, k, v$}
  \If{$T =$ NIL}
    \State $T \gets$ \Call{EmptyNode}{}
  \EndIf
  \State $p \gets T$
  \While{$k \neq 0$}
    \If{\Call{Even?}{$k$}}
      \If{\Call{Left}{$p$} = NIL}
        \State \Call{Left}{$p$} $\gets$ \Call{EmptyNode}{}
      \EndIf
      \State $p \gets$ \Call{Left}{$p$}
    \Else
      \If{\Call{Right}{$p$} = NIL}
        \State \Call{Right}{$p$} $\gets$ \Call{EmptyNode}{}
      \EndIf
      \State $p \gets$ \Call{Right}{$p$}
    \EndIf
    \State $k \gets \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$
  \EndWhile
  \State \Call{Data}{$p$} $\gets v$
  \State \Return $T$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
%\end{algorithm}

This algorithm takes 3 arguments, a Trie $T$, a key $k$, and the satellite
date $v$. The following Python example code implements the insertion algorithm.
The satellite data is optional, it is empty by default.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
def trie_insert(t, key, value = None):
    if t is None:
        t = IntTrie()
    p = t
    while key != 0:
        if key & 1 == 0:
            if p.left is None:
                p.left = IntTrie()
            p = p.left
        else:
            if p.right is None:
                p.right = IntTrie()
            p = p.right
        key = key>>1
    p.value = value
    return t
\end{lstlisting}

Figure \ref{int-trie} shows a trie which is created by inserting
pairs of key and value
\{$ 1 \rightarrow a, 4 \rightarrow b, 5 \rightarrow c, 9 \rightarrow d$\}
to the empty trie.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/int-trie.ps}
  \caption{An little-endian integer binary trie for the map
          \{$ 1 \rightarrow a, 4 \rightarrow b, 5 \rightarrow c, 9 \rightarrow d$\}.}
  \label{fig:int-trie}
\end{figure}

Because the definition of the integer trie is recursive, it's nature to define
the insertion algorithm recursively. If the LSB is 0, it
means that the key to be inserted is even, we recursively insert
to the left child, we can divide the key by 2 to get
rid of the LSB. If the LSB is 1, the key is odd number, the recursive
insertion is applied to the right child. For trie $T$,
denote the left and right children as $T_l$ and $T_r$ respectively.
Thus $T = (T_l, d, T_r)$, where $d$ is the optional satellite data.
if $T$ is empty, $T_l$, $T_r$ and $d$ are defined as empty as well.

\be
insert(T, k, v) = \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  (T_l, v, T_r) & k = 0 \\
  (insert(T_l, k / 2, v), d, T_r) & even(k) \\
  (T_l, d, insert(T_r, \lfloor k / 2 \rfloor, v)) & otherwise
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

If the key to be inserted already exists, this algorithm just
overwrites the previous stored data. It can be replaced with
other alternatives, such as storing data as with linked-list etc.

The following Haskell example program implements the insertion
algorithm.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
insert t 0 x = Branch (left t) (Just x) (right t)
insert t k x | even k = Branch (insert (left t) (k `div` 2) x) (value t) (right t)
             | otherwise = Branch (left t) (value t) (insert (right t) (k `div` 2) x)

left (Branch l _ _) = l
left Empty = Empty

right (Branch _ _ r) = r
right Empty = Empty

value (Branch _ v _) = v
value Empty = Nothing
\end{lstlisting}

For a given integer $k$ with $m$ bits in binary, the insertion algorithm
resurses $m$ levels. The performance is bound to $O(m)$ time.

% ================================================================
%               Look up in integer binary trie
% ================================================================
\subsection{Look up}

To look up key $k$ in the little-endian integer binary trie. We take each
bit of $k$ from the left (LSB), then go left if this bit is 0, otherwise,
we go right. The looking up completes when all bits are consumed.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{Lookup}{$T, k$}
  \While{$x \neq 0 \land T \neq $NIL}
    \If{ \Call{Even?}{$x$} }
      \State $T \gets$ \Call{Left}{$T$}
    \Else
      \State $T \gets$ \Call{Right}{$T$}
    \EndIf
    \State $k \gets \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$
  \EndWhile
  \If{$T \neq $ NIL}
    \State \Return \Call{Data}{$T$}
  \Else
    \State \Return not found \EndIf
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

Below Python example code uses bit-wise operation to implements the
looking up algorithm.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
def lookup(t, key):
    while key != 0 and (t is not None):
        if key & 1 == 0:
            t = t.left
        else:
            t = t.right
        key = key>>1
    if t is not None:
        return t.value
    else:
        return None
\end{lstlisting}

Looking up can also be define in recusrive manner. If the tree is
empty, the lookup fails; If $k=0$, the satellite data is the result
to be found; If the last bit is 0, we recurisvely look up the
left child; otherwise, we look up the right child.

\be
lookup(T, k) =  \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  \Phi & T = \Phi \\
  d & k = 0 \\
  lookup(T_l, k / 2) & even(k) \\
  lookup(T_r, \lfloor k / 2 \rfloor) & otherwise
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

The following Haskell example program implements the recursive
look up algorithm.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
search Empty k = Nothing
search t 0 = value t
search t k = if even k then search (left t) (k `div` 2)
             else search (right t) (k `div` 2)
\end{lstlisting}

The looking up algorithm is bound to $O(m)$ time, where $m$ is the
number of bits for a given key.

% ================================================================
\section{Integer Patricia}
\label{int-patricia}

Trie has some drawbacks. It wasts a lot of
spaces. Note in figure \ref{int-trie}, only leafs store the real data.
Typically, the integer binary trie contains many nodes only have one child.
One improvement idea is to compress the chained nodes together.
Patricia is such a data structure invented by
Donald R. Morrison in 1968. Patricia means practical algorithm to retrieve information coded
in alphanumeric\cite{patricia-morrison}. It is another kind of
prefix tree.

Okasaki gives implementation of integer Patricia in \cite{okasaki-int-map}.
If we merge the chained nodes which have only one child together in figure \ref{fig:int-trie},
We can get a patricia as shown in figure \ref{fig:little-endian-patricia}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/little-endian-patricia.ps}
  \caption{Little endian patricia for the map
     \{$ 1 \rightarrow a, 4 \rightarrow b, 5 \rightarrow c, 9 \rightarrow d$\}.}
  \label{fig:little-endian-patricia}
\end{figure}

From this figure, we can find that the key for the sibling nodes is the
longest common prefix for them.
They branches out at certain bit. Patricia saves a lot of spaces compare
to trie.

Different from integer trie, using the big-endian integer in Patricia
doesn't cause the padding zero problem mentioned
in section \ref{int-trie}. All zero bits before MSB are omitted to save
space. Okasaki lists some significant advantages
of big-endian Patricia\cite{okasaki-int-map}.

% ================================================================
%                 Definition of int patricia tree
% ================================================================
\subsection{Definition}

Integer Patricia tree is a special kind of binary tree. It is either
empty or is a node. There are two different types of node.

\begin{itemize}
\item It can be a leaf contains integer key and optional satellite data;
\item or a branch node, contains the left and the right children. The
two children shares the longest common prefix bits for their keys.
For the left child, the next bit of the key is zero, while the next
bit is one for the right child.
\end{itemize}

The following Haskell example code defines Patricia accordingly.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
type Key = Int
type Prefix = Int
type Mask = Int

data IntTree a = Empty
               | Leaf Key a
               | Branch Prefix Mask (IntTree a) (IntTree a)
\end{lstlisting}

In order to tell from which bit the left and right children differ, a
mask is recorded in the branch node. Typically, a mask is power of 2,
like $2^n$ for some non-negative integer $n$, all
bits being lower than $n$ don't belong to the common prefix.

The following Python example code defines Patricia as well as
some auxiliary functions.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
class IntTree:
    def __init__(self, key = None, value = None):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.prefix = self.mask = None
        self.left = self.right = None

    def set_children(self, l, r):
        self.left = l
        self.right = r

    def replace_child(self, x, y):
        if self.left == x:
            self.left = y
        else:
            self.right = y

    def is_leaf(self):
        return self.left is None and self.right is None

    def get_prefix(self):
        if self.prefix is None:
            return self.key
        else:
            return self.prefix
\end{lstlisting}


% ================================================================
%                 Insertion of int patricia tree
% ================================================================
\subsection{Insertion}
When insert a key, if the tree is empty,
we can just create a leaf node with the given key and satellite data,
as shown in figure \ref{fig:int-patricia-insert-a}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{img/int-patricia-insert-a.ps}
  \caption{Left: the empty tree; Right: After insert key 12.}
  \label{fig:int-patricia-insert-a}
\end{figure}

If the tree is just a singleton leaf node $x$, we can create a new leaf $y$,
put the key and data into it. After that, we need create a new branch
node, and set $x$ and $y$ as the two children.
In order to determine if the $y$ should be the left or right node, we need
find the longest common prefix of $x$ and $y$. For example if $key(x)$
is 12 ($(1100)_2$ in binary), $key(y)$ is 15 ($(1111)_2$ in binary), then the longest
common prefix is $(11oo)_2$. Where $o$ denotes the bits we don't care about.
We can use another integer to mask those bits.
In this case, the mask number is 4 (100 in binary).
The next bit after the longest common prefix presents $2^1$. This bit is
0 in $key(x)$, while it is 1 in $key(y)$. We should set $x$ as the left
child and $y$ as the right child. Figure \ref{fig:int-patricia-insert-b}
shows this example.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{img/int-patricia-insert-b.ps}
  \caption{Left: A tree with singleton leaf 12; Right: After insert key 15.}
  \label{fig:int-patricia-insert-b}
\end{figure}

In case the tree is neither empty, nor a singleton leaf, we need
firstly check if the key to be inserted matches the longest common
prefix recorded in the root.
Then recursively insert the key to the left or the right child
according to the next bit of the common prefix.
For example, if insert key 14 ($(1110)_2$ in binary) to the result tree
in figure \ref{fig:int-patricia-insert-b}, since the common prefix is
$(11oo)_2$, and the next bit (the bit of $2^1$) is 1, we need recusively
insert to the right child.

If the key to be inserted doesn't match the longest
common prefix stored in the root, we need branch a new leaf
out. Figure \ref{fig:int-patricia-insert-c} shows these two different cases.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \subfloat[Insert key 14. It matches the longest common prefix $(1100)_2$; 14 is then recursively inserted to the right sub tree.]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/int-patricia-insert-c.ps}}\\
  \subfloat[Insert key 5. It doesn't match the longest common prefix $(1100)_2$, a new leaf is branched out.]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/int-patricia-insert-d.ps}}
  \caption{Insert key to branch node.}
  \label{fig:int-patricia-insert-c}
\end{figure}

For a given key $k$ and value $v$, denote $(k, v)$ is the leaf node. For branch
node, denote it in form of $(p, m, T_l, T_r)$, where $p$ is the longest common
prefix, $m$ is the mask, $T_l$ and $T_r$ are the left and right children.
Summarize the above cases, the insertion algorithm can be defined as the
following.

\be
insert(T, k, v) = \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  (k, v) & T = \Phi \lor T = (k, v') \\
  join(k, (k, v), k', T) & T = (k', v') \\
  (p, m, insert(T_l, k, v), T_r) & T = (p, m, T_l, T_r), match(k, p, m), zero(k, m) \\
  (p, m, T_l, insert(T_r, k, v)) & T = (p, m, T_l, T_r), match(k, p, m), \lnot zero(k, m) \\
  join(k, (k, v), p, T) & T = (p, m, T_l, T_r), \lnot match(k, p, m)
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

The first clause deals with the edge cases, that either $T$ is empty or
it is a leaf node with the same key. The algorithm overwrites the previous
value for the later case.

The second clause handles the case that $T$ is a leaf node, but with different
key. Here we need branch out another new leaf. We need extract the longest
common prefix, and determine which leaf should be set as the left, and
which should be set as the right child. Function $join(k_1, T_1, K_2, T_2)$
does this work. We'll define it later.

The third caluse deals with the case that $T$ is a branch node, the
longest common prefix matches the key to be inserted, and the next
bit to the common prefix is zero. Here we need recursively insert
to the left child.

The fourth caluse handles the similar case as the third caluse, except
that the next bit to the common prefix is one, but not zero. We need
recursively insert to the right child.

The last caluse is for the case that the key to be inserted doesn't
match the longest common prefix stored in the branch. We need branch
out a new leaf by calling the $join$ function.

We need define function $match(k, p, m)$ to test if the key $k$, has
the same prefix $p$ above the masked bits $m$.
For example, suppose the prefix stored in a branch node is
$(p_np_{n-1} ... p_i...p_0)_2$ in binary, key $k$ is
$(k_nk_{n-1} ... k_i ... k_0)_2$ in binary, and the mask is
$(100...0)_2=2^i$. They match if and only if $p_j=k_j$ for all $i \leq j \leq n$.

One solution to realize match is to test if $mask(k, m) = p$ is satisfied.
Where $mask(x, m) = \overline{m-1} \& x$, that we perform bitwise-not of $m-1$, then
perform bitwise-and with $x$.

Function $zero(k, m)$ test the next bit of the common prefix is zero.
With the help of the mask $m$, we can shift $m$ one bit to the right,
then perform bitwise and with the key.

\be
zero(k, m) = x \& shift_r(m, 1)
\ee

If the mask $m = (100..0)_2 = 2^i$, $k = (k_nk_{n-1}...k_i1...k_0)_2$,
because the bit next to $k_i$ is 1, $zero(k, m)$ returns false value;
if $k = (k_nk_{n-1}...k_i0...k_0)_2$, then the result is true.

Function $join(p_1, T_1, p_2, T_2)$ takes two different prefixes and trees.
It extracts the longest common prefix of $p_1$ and $p_2$, create a
new branch node, and set $T_1$ and $T_2$ as the two children.

\be
join(p_1, T_1, p_2, T_2) = \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  (p, m, T_1, T_2) & zero(p1, m), (p, m) = LCP(p_1, p_2) \\
  (p, m, T_2, T_1) & \lnot zero(p1, m)
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

In order to calculate the longest common prefix of $p_1$ and $p_2$,
we can firstly compute bitwise exclusive-or for them, then count
the number of bits in this result, and generate a mask $m = 2^{|xor(p_1,p_2)|}$.
The longest common prefix $p$ can be given by masking the bits with $m$
for either $p_1$ or $p_2$.

\be
p = mask(p_1, m)
\ee

The following Haskell example code implements the insertion algorithm.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
import Data.Bits

insert t k x
   = case t of
       Empty -> Leaf k x
       Leaf k' x' -> if k==k' then Leaf k x
                     else join k (Leaf k x) k' t -- t@(Leaf k' x')
       Branch p m l r
          | match k p m -> if zero k m
                           then Branch p m (insert l k x) r
                           else Branch p m l (insert r k x)
          | otherwise -> join k (Leaf k x) p t -- t@(Branch p m l r)

join p1 t1 p2 t2 = if zero p1 m then Branch p m t1 t2
                                else Branch p m t2 t1
    where
      (p, m) = lcp p1 p2

lcp :: Prefix -> Prefix -> (Prefix, Mask)
lcp p1 p2 = (p, m) where
    m = bit (highestBit (p1 `xor` p2))
    p = mask p1 m

highestBit x = if x == 0 then 0 else 1 + highestBit (shiftR x 1)

mask x m = (x .&. complement (m-1)) -- complement means bit-wise not.

zero x m = x .&. (shiftR m 1) == 0

match k p m = (mask k m) == p
\end{lstlisting}

The insertion algorithm can also be realized imperatively.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]

Function \textproc{Branch}($T_1, T_2$) does the similiar job as what $join$ is defined.
It creates a new branch node, extracts the longest common prefix, and sets $T_1$ and
$T_2$ as the two children.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]

The following Python example program implements the insertion algorithm.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
def insert(t, key, value = None):
    if t is None:
        t = IntTree(key, value)
        return t

    node = t
    parent = None
    while(True):
        if match(key, node):
            parent = node
            if zero(key, node.mask):
                node = node.left
            else:
                node = node.right
        else:
            if node.is_leaf() and key == node.key:
                node.value = value
            else:
                new_node = branch(node, IntTree(key, value))
                if parent is None:
                    t = new_node
                else:
                    parent.replace_child(node, new_node)
            break
    return t
\end{lstlisting}

The auxiliary functions, \texttt{match}, \texttt{branch}, \texttt{lcp} etc. are given as below.

\begin{lstlisting}
def maskbit(x, mask):
    return x & (~(mask-1))

def match(key, tree):
    return (not tree.is_leaf()) and maskbit(key, tree.mask) == tree.prefix

def zero(x, mask):
    return x & (mask>>1) == 0

def lcp(p1, p2):
    diff = (p1 ^ p2)
    mask=1
    while(diff!=0):
        diff>>=1
        mask<<=1
    return (maskbit(p1, mask), mask)

def branch(t1, t2):
    t = IntTree()
    (t.prefix, t.mask) = lcp(t1.get_prefix(), t2.get_prefix())
    if zero(t1.get_prefix(), t.mask):
        t.set_children(t1, t2)
    else:
        t.set_children(t2, t1)
    return t
\end{lstlisting}

with the insertion algorithm.

\end{figure}


% ================================================================
%                 Lookup in int patricia tree
% ================================================================
\subsection{Look up}
Consider the property of integer Patricia tree. When look up a
key, if it has common prefix with the root,
then we check the next bit. If
this bit is zero, we recursively look up the left child;
otherwise if the bit is one, we next look up the right child.

When reach a leaf node, we can directly check if the key of the
leaf is equal to what we are looking up. This algorithm can be
described with the following pseudo code.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{Look-Up}{$T, k$}
  \If{$T =$ NIL}
    \State \Return $NIL$ \Comment{Not found}
  \EndIf
  \While{$T$ is not leaf, and \textproc{Match}($k$, \Call{Prefix}{$T$}, \Call{Mask}{$T$})}
    \If{\textproc{Zero?}($k$, \Call{Mask}{$T$})}
      \State $T \gets$ \Call{Left}{$T$}
    \Else
      \State $T \gets$ \Call{Right}{$T$}
    \EndIf
  \EndWhile
  \If{$T$ is leaf, and \Call{Key}{$T$} $=k$}
    \State \Return \Call{Data}{$T$}
  \Else
    \State \Return $NIL$ \Comment{Not found}
  \EndIf
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

Below Python example program implements the looking up algorithm.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
def lookup(t, key):
    if t is None:
        return None
    while (not t.is_leaf()) and match(key, t):
        if zero(key, t.mask):
            t = t.left
        else:
            t = t.right
    if t.is_leaf() and t.key == key:
        return t.value
    else:
        return None
\end{lstlisting}

The looking up algorithm can also be realized in recursive apporach.
If the Patricia tree $T$ is empty, or it's a singleton leaf with
different key from what we are looking up, the result is empty to
indicate not found error; If the tree is a singleton leaf, and the
key of this leaf is equal to what we are looking up, we are done.
Otherwise, $T$ is a branch node, we need check if the common
prefix matches the key to be looked up, and recursively look up
the child according to the next bit. If the common prefix doesn't
match the key, it means the key doesn't exist in the tree. We
can return empty result to indicate not found error.

\be
lookup(T, k) = \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  \Phi & T = \Phi \lor (T = (k', v), k' \neq k) \\
  v & T = (k', v), k' = k \\
  lookup(T_l, k) & T = (p, m, T_l, T_r), match(k, p, m), zero(k, m) \\
  lookup(T_r, k) & T = (p, m, T_l, T_r), match(k, p, m), \lnot zero(k, m) \\
  \Phi & otherwise
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

The following Haskell example program implements this recursive
looking up algorithm.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
search t k
  = case t of
      Empty -> Nothing
      Leaf k' x -> if k==k' then Just x else Nothing
      Branch p m l r
             | match k p m -> if zero k m then search l k
                              else search r k
             | otherwise -> Nothing
\end{lstlisting}

%                 Alphabetic trie
% ================================================================
\section{Alphabetic Trie}
Integer based Trie and Patricia Tree can be a good start point. Such
technical plays important role in Compiler implementation. Okasaki
pointed that the widely used Glasgow Haskell Compiler, GHC,
utilized the similar implementation for several years before
1998 \cite{okasaki-int-map}.

If we extend the key from integer to alphabetic
value, Trie and Patricia tree can be very powerful in solving
textual manipulation problems.

% ================================================================
%                 Definition of Alphabetic trie
% ================================================================
\subsection{Definition}
It's not enough to just use the left and right children to represent
alphabetic keys. Using English for example, there are 26 letters
and each can be lower or upper case. If we don't care about the case,
one solution is to limit the number of branches (children) to 26.
Some simplified ANSI C implementations of Trie are defined by using
the array of 26 letters. This can be illustrated as in Figure \ref{fig:trie-of-26}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/trie-of-26.ps}
  \caption{A Trie with 26 branches, containing key 'a', 'an', 'another', 'bool',
    'boy' and 'zoo'.}
  \label{fig:trie-of-26}
\end{figure}

Not all branch nodes contain data. For instance, in Figure \ref{fig:trie-of-26},
the root only has three non-empty branches representing letter 'a',
'b', and 'z'. Other branches such as for letter c, are all
empty. We don't show empty branches in the rest of this chapter.

If deal with case sensitive problems, or handle languages other than English,
there can be more letters than 26. The problem of dynamic size of sub
branches can be solved by using some collection data strucutures. Such
as Hash table or map.

A alphabetic trie is either empty or a node. There are two types of node.

\begin{itemize}
\item A leaf node don't has any sub trees;
\item A branch node contains multiple sub trees. Each sub stree is bound to a character.
\end{itemize}

Both leaf and branch may contain optional satellite data. The following Haskell
code shows the example definition.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
data Trie a = Trie { value :: Maybe a
                   , children :: [(Char, Trie a)]}

empty = Trie Nothing []
\end{lstlisting}

Below ANSI C code defines the alphabetic trie. For illustration purpose only,
we limit the character set to lower case English letters, from 'a' to 'z'.

\lstset{language=C}
\begin{lstlisting}
struct Trie {
  struct Trie* children[26];
  void* data;
};
\end{lstlisting}


% ================================================================
%                 Insertion of Alphabetic trie
% ================================================================
\subsection{Insertion}

When insert string as key, start from the root, we pick the character
one by one from the string, examine which child represents the character.
If the corresponding child is empty, a new empty node is created.
After that, the next character is used to select the proper grand child.

We repeat this process for all the characters, and finally store the
optional satellite data in the node we arrived at.

Below pseudo code describes the insertion algorithm.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{Insert}{$T, k, v$}
  \If{$T = $ NIL}
    \State $T \gets $ \Call{EmptyNode}{}
  \EndIf
  \State $p \gets T$
  \For{each $c$ in $k$}
    \If{\Call{Children}{$p$}[c] = NIL}
      \State \Call{Children}{$p$}[c] $\gets$ \Call{EmptyNode}{}
    \EndIf
    \State $p \gets $ \Call{Children}{$p$}[c]
  \EndFor
  \State \Call{Data}{$p$} $\gets v$
  \State \Return $T$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

The following example ANSI C program implements the insertion algorithm.

\lstset{language=C}
\begin{lstlisting}
struct Trie* insert(struct Trie* t, const char* key, void* value){
    int c;
    struct Trie *p;
    if(!t)
        t = create_node();
    for (p = t; *key; ++key, p = p->children[c]) {
        c = *key - 'a';
        if (!p->children[c])
            p->children[c] = create_node();
    }
    p->data = value;
    return t;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Where function \texttt{create\_node} creates new empty node, with all
children initialized to empty.

\begin{lstlisting}
struct Trie* create_node(){
    struct Trie* t = (struct Trie*) malloc(sizeof(struct Trie));
    int i;
    for (i=0; i<26; ++i)
        t->children[i] = NULL;
    t->data = NULL;
    return t;
}
\end{lstlisting}


The insertion can also be realized in recursive way. Denote the
key to be inserted as $K = k_1k_2...k_n$, where $k_i$ is the $i$-th
character. $K'$ is the rest of characters except $k_1$. $v'$ is the
satallite data to be inserted.
The trie is in form $T = (v, C)$, where $v$ is the satellite
data, $C = \{(c_1, T_1), (c_2, T_2), ..., (c_m, T_m)\}$ is the
map of children. It maps from character $c_i$ to
sub-tree $T_i$. if $T$ is empty, then $C$ is also empty.

\be
insert(T, K, v') = \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  (v', C) & K = \Phi \\
  (v, ins(C, k_1, K', v')) & otherwise.
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

If the key is empty, the previous value $v$ is overwritten with
$v'$. Otherwise, we need check the children and perform
recursive insertion. This is realized in function $ins(C, k_1, K', v')$.
It examines key-sub tree pairs in $C$ one by one. Let $C'$ be
the rest of pairs except for the first one. This function
can be defined as below.

\be
ins(C, k_1, K', v') = \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  \{(k_1, insert(\Phi, K', v'))\} & C = \Phi \\
  \{k_1, insert(T_1, K', v')\} \cup C' & k_1 = c_1 \\
  \{(c_1, T_1)\} \cup ins(C', k_1, K', v') & otherwise
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

If $C$ is empty, we create a pair, mapping from character $k_1$ to
a new empty tree, and recursively insert the rest characters.
Otherwise, the algorithm locates the child which is mapped
from $k_1$ for further insertion.

The following Haskell example program implements the insertion
algorithm.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
insert t []     x = Trie (Just x)  (children t)
insert t (k:ks) x = Trie (value t) (ins (children t) k ks x) where
    ins [] k ks x = [(k, (insert empty ks x))]
    ins (p:ps) k ks x = if fst p == k
                        then (k, insert (snd p) ks x):ps
                        else p:(ins ps k ks x)
\end{lstlisting}


% ================================================================
%                 Look up in Alphabetic trie
% ================================================================
\subsection{Look up}

To look up a key, we also extract the character from the
key one by one. For each character, we search among the children
to see if there is a branch match this character.
If there is no such a child, the look up process terminates
immediately to indicate the not found error.
When we reach the last character of the key,
The data stored in the current node is what we are looking up.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{Look-Up}{$T, key$}
  \If{$T = $ NIL}
    \State \Return not found
  \EndIf
  \For{each $c$ in $key$}
    \If{\Call{Children}{$T$}[$c$] = NIL}
      \State \Return not found
    \EndIf
    \State $T \gets $ \Call{Children}{$T$}[$c$]
  \EndFor
  \State \Return \Call{Data}{$T$}
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

Below ANSI C program implements the look up algorithm. It returns NULL to indicate
not found error.

\lstset{language=C}
\begin{lstlisting}
void* lookup(struct Trie* t, const char* key) {
    while (*key && t && t->children[*key - 'a'])
        t = t->children[*key++ - 'a'];
    return (*key || !t) ? NULL : t->data;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The look up algorithm can also be realized in recursive manner. When
look up a key, we start from the first character.
If it is bound to some child, we then
recursively search the rest characters in that child.
Denote the trie as $T = (v, C)$, the key being searched as
$K = k_1k_2...k_n$ if it isn't empty. The first character in
the key is $k_1$, and the rest characters are denoted as $K'$.

\be
lookup(T, K) = \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  v & K = \Phi \\
  \Phi & find(C, k_1) = \Phi \\
  lookup(T', K') & find(C, k_1) = T'
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

Where function $find(C, k)$ examine the pairs of key-child one by one to check
if any child is bound to character $k$. If the list of pairs $C$ is empty,
the result is empty to indicate non-existence of such a child. Otherwise,
let $C = \{(k_1, T_1), (k_2, T_2), ..., (k_m, T_m)\}$, the first sub tree $T_1$
is bound to $k_1$; the rest of pairs are represented as $C'$. Below
equation defines the $find$ function.

\be
find(C, k) = \left \{
  \begin{array}
  {r@{\quad:\quad}l}
  \Phi & C = \Phi \\
  T_1 & k_1 = k \\
  find(C', k) & otherwise
  \end{array}
\right.
\ee

The following Haskell example program implements the trie looking up
algorithm. It uses the \texttt{find} function provided in standard library\cite{wiki-trie}.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
find t [] = value t
find t (k:ks) = case lookup k (children t) of
                  Nothing -> Nothing
                  Just t' -> find t' ks
\end{lstlisting}

%                 Alphabetic Patricia Tree
% ================================================================
\section{Alphabetic Patricia}

Similar to integer trie, alphabetic trie is not memory
efficient. We can use the same method to compress alphabetic trie to
Patricia.

% ================================================================
%                 Definition of Alphabetic Patricia Tree
% ================================================================
\subsection{Definition}

Alphabetic Patricia tree is a special prefix tree, each node contains
multiple branches. All children of a node share the longest common
prefix string. As the result, there is no node with only one child,
because it conflicts with the longest common prefix property.

If we turn the trie shown in figure \ref{fig:trie-of-26} into Patricia
by compressing all nodes which have only one child. we can get
a Patricia prefix tree as in figure \ref{fig:patricia-tree}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/patricia-tree.ps}
  \caption{A Patricia prefix tree, with keys: 'a', 'an', 'another', 'bool',
    'boy' and 'zoo'.}
  \label{fig:patricia-tree}
\end{figure}

We can modify the definition of alphabetic trie a bit to adapt it
to Patricia. The Patricia is either empty, or a node in form $T = (v, C)$.
Where $v$ is the optional satellite data; $C = \{(s_1, T_1), (s_2, T_2), ..., (s_n, T_n)\}$
is a list of pairs. Each pair contains a string $s_i$, which is bound
to a sub tree $T_i$.

The following Haskell example code defines Patricia accordingly.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
type Key = String

data Patricia a = Patricia { value :: Maybe a
                           , children :: [(Key, Patricia a)]}

empty = Patricia Nothing []
\end{lstlisting}

Below Python code reuses the definition for trie to define Patricia.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Patricia:
    def __init__(self, value = None):
        self.value = value
        self.children = {}
\end{lstlisting}

% ================================================================
%                 Insertion of Alphabetic Patrica Tree
% ================================================================
\subsection{Insertion}

When insert a key, $s$, if the Patricia is empty, we
create a leaf node. Otherwise, we need check the children.
If there is some sub tree $T_i$ bound to the string $s_i$,
and there exists common prefix between $s_i$ and $s$, we
need branch out a new leaf $T_j$. The method is to
create a new internal branch node, bind it with the common
prefix. Then set $T_i$ as one child of this branch, and
$T_j$ as the other child. $T_i$ and $T_j$ share the common
prefix. Each new
branches is represent with the different parts. Note there are 2 special
cases. One is that $s$ is the substring of $s_i$, the other is that $s_i$
is the substring of $s$. Figure \ref{fig:patricia-insert} shows these
different cases.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
       \begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/patricia-insert-a.ps} (a)
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/patricia-insert-b.ps} (b)
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/patricia-insert-c.ps} (c)
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/patricia-insert-d.ps} (d)
        \caption{(a). Insert key, ``boy'' into an empty Patricia tree,
	the result is a leaf node; \newline
	(b). Insert key, ``bool'' into (a), result is a branch with
	common prefix ``bo''. \newline
        (c). Insert ``an'', with value $y$ into node $x$ with prefix
	``another''. \newline
        (d). Insert ``another'', into a node with prefix ``an'', the key to be inserted update to ``other'', and do further insertion.}
        \label{fig:patricia-insert}
       \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Iterative insertion algorithm for alphabetic Patricia}

The insertion algorithm can be described as below pseudo code.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{PATRICIA-INSERT}{$T, key, value$}
\If{$T = NIL$}
   \State $T \leftarrow NewNode$ \EndIf

  \State $p=T$
  \Loop
    \State $match \leftarrow FALSE$
    \For{each $i$ in $CHILDREN(p)$}
      \If{$key = KEY(i)$}
        \State $VALUE(p) \leftarrow value$
        \State \Return $T$
      \EndIf

      \State $prefix \leftarrow LONGEST-COMMON-PREFIX(key, KEY(i))$
      \State $key1 \leftarrow key$ subtract $prefix$
      \State $key2 \leftarrow KEY(i)$ subtract $prefix$
      \If{$prefix \neq NIL$}
        \State $match \leftarrow TRUE$
        \If{$key2 = NIL$}
          \State $p \leftarrow TREE(i)$
          \State $key \leftarrow key$ substract $prefix$
          \State break
        \Else
          \State $CHILDREN(p)[prefix] \leftarrow BRANCH(key1, value, key2, TREE(i))$
          \State DELETE $CHILDREN(p)[KEY(i)]$
          \State \Return $T$
        \EndIf
      \EndIf

      \If{$match = FALSE$}
        \State $CHILDREN(p)[key] \leftarrow CREATE-LEAF(value)$
      \EndIf
    \EndFor

  \EndLoop
  \State \Return $T$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

In the above algorithm, LONGEST-COMMON-PREFIX function will find the longest
common prefix of two given string, for example, string ``bool'' and ``boy''
has longest common prefix ``bo''. BRANCH function will create a branch node
and update keys accordingly.

\subsubsection*{Insertion of alphabetic Patricia in C++}
in C++, to support implicit type conversion we utilize the KeyType and
ValueType as parameter types. If we define Patricia<std::string,
std::string>, we can directly provide char* parameters. the algorithm
is implemented as the following.

\lstset{language=C++}
\begin{lstlisting}
template<class K, class V>
Patricia<K, V>* insert(Patricia<K, V>* t,
                       typename Patricia<K, V>::KeyType key,
                       typename Patricia<K, V>::ValueType value=V()){
  if(!t)
    t = new Patricia<K, V>();

  Patricia<K, V>* p = t;
  typedef typename Patricia<K, V>::Children::iterator Iterator;
  for(;;){
    bool match(false);
    for(Iterator it = p->children.begin(); it!=p->children.end(); ++it){
      K k=it->first;
      if(key == k){
        p->value = value; //overwrite
        return t;
      }
      K prefix = lcp(key, k);
      if(!prefix.empty()){
        match=true;
        if(k.empty()){ //e.g. insert "another" into "an"
          p = it->second;
          break;
        }
        else{
          p->children[prefix] = branch(key, new Patricia<K, V>(value),
                                       k, it->second);
          p->children.erase(it);
          return t;
        }
      }
    }
    if(!match){
      p->children[key] = new Patricia<K, V>(value);
      break;
    }
  }
  return t;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Where the lcp and branch functions are defined like this.

\begin{lstlisting}
template<class K>
K lcp(K& s1, K& s2){
  typename K::iterator it1(s1.begin()), it2(s2.begin());
  for(; it1!=s1.end() && it2!=s2.end() && *it1 == *it2; ++it1, ++it2);
  K res(s1.begin(), it1);
  s1 = K(it1, s1.end());
  s2 = K(it2, s2.end());
  return res;
}

template<class T>
T* branch(typename T::KeyType k1, T* t1,
          typename T::KeyType k2, T* t2){
  if(k1.empty()){ //e.g. insert "an" into "another"
    t1->children[k2] = t2;
    return t1;
  }
  T* t = new T();
  t->children[k1] = t1;
  t->children[k2] = t2;
  return t;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Function lcp() will extract the longest common prefix and modify its
parameters. Function branch() will create a new node and set the 2
nodes to be merged as the children. There is a special case, if the
key of one node is sub-string of the other, it will chain them
together.

We find the implementation of patricia\_to\_str() will be very same
as trie\_to\_str(), so we can reuse it. Also the convert from a list
of keys to trie can be reused

\begin{lstlisting}
// list_to_trie
template<class Iterator, class T>
T* list_to_trie(Iterator first, Iterator last, T* t){
  typedef typename T::ValueType ValueType;
  return std::accumulate(first, last, t,
                         std::ptr_fun(insert_key<T, ValueType>));
}
\end{lstlisting}

We put all of the helper function templates to a utility header file,
and we can test patricia insertion program as below.

\begin{lstlisting}
template<class Iterator>
void test_list_to_patricia(Iterator first, Iterator last){
  typedef Patricia<std::string, std::string> PatriciaType;
  PatriciaType* t(0);
  t = list_to_trie(first, last, t);
  std::copy(first, last,
            std::ostream_iterator<std::string>(std::cout, ", "));
  std::cout<<"\n==>"<<trie_to_str(t)<<"\n";
  delete t;
}

void test_insert(){
  const char* lst1[] = {"a", "an", "another", "b", "bob", "bool", "home"};
  test_list_to_patricia(lst1, lst1+sizeof(lst1)/sizeof(char*));

  const char* lst2[] = {"home", "bool", "bob", "b", "another", "an", "a"};
  test_list_to_patricia(lst2, lst2+sizeof(lst2)/sizeof(char*));

  const char* lst3[] = {"romane", "romanus", "romulus"};
  test_list_to_patricia(lst3, lst3+sizeof(lst3)/sizeof(char*));

  typedef Patricia<std::string, std::string> PatriciaType;
  PatriciaType* t(0);
  const char* keys[] = {"001", "100", "101"};
  const char* vals[] = {"y", "x", "z"};
  for(unsigned int i=0; i<sizeof(keys)/sizeof(char*); ++i)
    t = insert(t, std::string(keys[i]), std::string(vals[i]));
  std::copy(keys, keys+sizeof(keys)/sizeof(char*),
	    std::ostream_iterator<std::string>(std::cout, ", "));
  std::cout<<"==>"<<trie_to_str(t)<<"\n";
  delete t;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Running test\_insert() function will generate the following output.

\begin{verbatim}
a, an, another, b, bob, bool, home,
==>(, (a, (an, (another))), (b, (bo, (bob), (bool))), (home))
home, bool, bob, b, another, an, a,
==>(, (a, (an, (another))), (b, (bo, (bob), (bool))), (home))
romane, romanus, romulus,
==>(, (rom, (roman, (romane), (romanus)), (romulus)))
001, 100, 101, ==>(, (001:y), (10, (100:x), (101:z)))
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Insertion of alphabetic Patrica Tree in Python}
By translate the insertion algorithm into Python language, we can get a
program as below.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
def insert(t, key, value = None):
    if t is None:
        t = Patricia()

    node = t
    while(True):
        match = False
        for k, tr in node.children.items():
            if key == k: # just overwrite
                node.value = value
                return t
            (prefix, k1, k2)=lcp(key, k)
            if prefix != "":
                match = True
                if k2 == "":
                    # example: insert "another" into "an", go on traversing
                    node = tr
                    key = k1
                    break
                else: #branch out a new leaf
                    node.children[prefix] = branch(k1, Patricia(value), k2, tr)
                    del node.children[k]
                    return t
        if not match: # add a new leaf
            node.children[key] = Patricia(value)
            break
    return t
\end{lstlisting}

Where the longest common prefix finding and branching functions are implemented
as the following.

\begin{lstlisting}
# longest common prefix
# returns (p, s1', s2'), where p is lcp, s1'=s1-p, s2'=s2-p
def lcp(s1, s2):
    j=0
    while j<=len(s1) and j<=len(s2) and s1[0:j]==s2[0:j]:
        j+=1
    j-=1
    return (s1[0:j], s1[j:], s2[j:])

def branch(key1, tree1, key2, tree2):
    if key1 == "":
        #example: insert "an" into "another"
        tree1.children[key2] = tree2
        return tree1
    t = Patricia()
    t.children[key1] = tree1
    t.children[key2] = tree2
    return t
\end{lstlisting}

Function lcp check every characters of two strings are same one by one
till it met a different one or either of the string finished.

In order to test the insertion program, some helper functions are
provided.

\begin{lstlisting}
def to_string(t):
    return trie_to_str(t)

def list_to_patricia(l):
    return from_list(l, insert)

def map_to_patricia(m):
    return from_map(m, insert)
\end{lstlisting}

We can reuse the trie\_to\_str since their implementation are same.
to\_string function can turn a Patricia tree into string by traversing it
in pre-order. list\_to\_patricia helps to convert a list of object into
a Patricia tree by repeatedly insert every elements into the tree. While
map\_to\_string does similar thing except it can convert a list of key-value
pairs into a Patricia tree.

Then we can test the insertion program with below test cases.

\begin{lstlisting}
class PatriciaTest:
    #...
    def test_insert(self):
        print "test insert"
        t = list_to_patricia(["a", "an", "another", "b", "bob", "bool", "home"])
        print to_string(t)
        t = list_to_patricia(["romane", "romanus", "romulus"])
        print to_string(t)
        t = map_to_patricia({"001":'y', "100":'x', "101":'z'})
        print to_string(t)
        t = list_to_patricia(["home", "bool", "bob", "b", "another", "an", "a"]);
        print to_string(t)
\end{lstlisting}

These test cases will output a series of result like this.

\begin{verbatim}
(, (a, (an, (another))), (b, (bo, (bob), (bool))), (home))
(, (rom, (roman, (romane), (romanus)), (romulus)))
(, (001:y), (10, (100:x), (101:z)))
(, (a, (an, (another))), (b, (bo, (bob), (bool))), (home))
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Recursive insertion algorithm for alphabetic Patricia}

The insertion can also be implemented recursively. When doing
insertion, the program check all the children of the Patricia node, to
see if there is a node can match the key. Match means they have common
prefix. One special case is that the keys are same, the program just
overwrite the value of that child. If there is no child can match the
key, the program create a new leaf, and add it as a new child.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{PATRICIA-INSERT'}{$T, key, value$}
\If{$T = NIL$}
   \State $T \leftarrow EmptyNode$ \EndIf

\State $p \leftarrow FIND-MATCH(CHILDREN(T), key)$
\If{$p = NIL$}
  \State $ADD(CHILDREN(T), CREATE-LEAF(key, value))$
\ElsIf{$KEY(p) = key$}
  \State $VALUE(p) \leftarrow value$
\Else
  \State $q \leftarrow BRANCH(CREATE-LEAF(key, value), p)$
  \State $ADD(CHILDREN(T), q)$
  \State $DELETE(CHILDREN(T), p)$
\EndIf
\State \Return $T$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

The recursion happens inside call to BRANCH. The longest common prefix
of 2 nodes are extracted. If the key to be inserted is the sub-string of
the node, we just chain them together; If the prefix of the node is
the sub-string of the key, we recursively insert the rest of the key
to the node. In other case, we create a new node with the common
prefix and set its two children.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{BRANCH}{$T1, T2$}
  \State $prefix \leftarrow LONGEST-COMMON-PREFIX(T1, T2)$

  \State $p \leftarrow EmptyNode$
  \If{$prefix = KEY(T1)$}
    \State $KEY(T2) \leftarrow KEY(T2)$ subtract $prefix$
    \State $p \leftarrow CREATE-LEAF(prefix, VALUE(T1))$
    \State $ADD(CHILDREN(p), T2)$
  \ElsIf{$prefix = KEY(T2)$}
    \State $KEY(T1) \leftarrow KEY(T1)$ subtract $prefix$
    \State $p \leftarrow PATRICIA-INSERT'(T2, KEY(T1), VALUE(T1))$
    \State $KEY(p) \leftarrow prefix$
  \Else
    \State $KEY(T2) \leftarrow KEY(T2)$ subtract $prefix$
    \State $KEY(T1) \leftarrow KEY(T1)$ subtract $prefix$
    \State $ADD(CHILDREN(p), T1, T2)$
    \State $KEY(p) \leftarrow prefix$
  \EndIf
  \State \Return $p$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\subsubsection*{Insertion of alphabetic Patrica Tree in Haskell}
By implementing the above algorithm in Recursive way, we can get a
Haskell program of Patricia insertion.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
insert :: Patricia a -> Key -> a -> Patricia a
insert t k x = Patricia (value t) (ins (children t) k x) where
    ins []     k x = [(k, Patricia (Just x) [])]
    ins (p:ps) k x
        | (fst p) == k
            = (k, Patricia (Just x) (children (snd p))):ps --overwrite
        | match (fst p) k
            = (branch k x (fst p) (snd p)):ps
        | otherwise
            = p:(ins ps k x)

\end{lstlisting}

Function insert takes a Patricia tree, a key and a value. It will call
an internal function ins to insert the data into the children of the tree.
If the tree has no children, it simply create a leaf node and put it
as the single child of the tree. In other case it will check each child
to see if any one has common prefix with the key. There is a special case,
the child has very same key, we can overwrite the data. If the child has common
prefix is located, we branch out a new node.

A function match is provided to determine if two keys have common prefix as
below.

\begin{lstlisting}
match :: Key -> Key -> Bool
match [] _ = False
match _ [] = False
match x y = head x == head y
\end{lstlisting}

This function is straightforward, only if the first character of the two keys
are identical, we say they have common prefix.

Branch out function and the longest common prefix function are implemented like
the following.

\begin{lstlisting}
branch :: Key -> a -> Key -> Patricia a -> (Key, Patricia a)
branch k1 x k2 t2
    | k1 == k
        -- ex: insert "an" into "another"
        = (k, Patricia (Just x) [(k2', t2)])
    | k2 == k
        -- ex: insert "another" into "an"
        = (k, insert t2 k1' x)
    | otherwise = (k, Patricia Nothing [(k1', leaf x), (k2', t2)])
   where
      k = lcp k1 k2
      k1' = drop (length k) k1
      k2' = drop (length k) k2

lcp :: Key -> Key -> Key
lcp [] _ = []
lcp _ [] = []
lcp (x:xs) (y:ys) = if x==y then x:(lcp xs ys) else []
\end{lstlisting}

Function take a key, k1, a value, another key, k2, and a Patricia tree t2. It will first
call lcp to get the longest common prefix, k, and the different part of the original key.
If k is just k1, which means k1 is a sub-string of k2, we create a new Patricia node,
put the new value in it, then set the left part of k2 and t2 as the single child of this
new node. If k is just k2, which means k2 is a sub-string of k1, we recursively insert
the update key and value to t2. Otherwise, we create a new node, along with the the longest
common prefix. the new node has 2 children, one is t2, the other is a leaf node of the data
to be inserted. Each of them are binding to updated keys.

In order to test the above program, we provided some helper functions.

\begin{lstlisting}
fromList :: [(Key, a)] -> Patricia a
fromList xs = foldl ins empty xs where
    ins t (k, v) = insert t k v

sort :: (Ord a)=>[(a, b)] -> [(a, b)]
sort [] = []
sort (p:ps) = sort xs ++ [p] ++ sort ys where
    xs = [x | x<-ps, fst x <= fst p ]
    ys = [y | y<-ps, fst y > fst p ]

toString :: (Show a)=>Patricia a -> String
toString t = toStr t "" where
    toStr t prefix = "(" ++ prefix ++ showMaybe (value t) ++
                     (concat $ map (\(k, v)->", " ++ toStr v (prefix++k))
                             (sort $children t))
                     ++ ")"
    showMaybe Nothing = ""
    showMaybe (Just x) = ":" ++ show x
\end{lstlisting}

Function fromList can recursively insert each key-value pair into a Patricia node.
Function sort helps to sort a list of key-value pairs based on keys by using quick sort
algorithm. toString turns a Patricia tree into a string by using modified pre-order.

After that, we can test our insert program with the following test cases.

\begin{lstlisting}
testPatricia = "t1=" ++ (toString t1) ++ "\n" ++
               "t2=" ++ (toString t2)
    where
      t1 = fromList [("a", 1), ("an", 2), ("another", 7),
                     ("boy", 3), ("bool", 4), ("zoo", 3)]
      t2 = fromList [("zoo", 3), ("bool", 4), ("boy", 3),
                     ("another", 7), ("an", 2), ("a", 1)]

main = do
  putStrLn testPatricia
\end{lstlisting}

No matter what's the insert order, the 2 test cases output an identical result.

\begin{verbatim}
t1=(, (a:1, (an:2, (another:7))), (bo, (bool:4), (boy:3)), (zoo:3))
t2=(, (a:1, (an:2, (another:7))), (bo, (bool:4), (boy:3)), (zoo:3))
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection*{Insertion of alphabetic Patrica Tree in Scheme/Lisp}

In Scheme/Lisp, If the root doesn't has child, we create a leaf node
with the value, and bind the key with this node; if the key binding to
one child is equal to the string we want to insert, we just overwrite
the current value; If the key has common prefix of the string to be
inserted, we branch out a new node.

\lstset{language=lisp}
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (insert t k x)
  (define (ins lst k x) ;; lst: [(key patrica)]
    (if (null? lst) (list (make-child k (make-leaf x)))
	(cond ((string=? (key (car lst)) k)
	       (cons (make-child k (make-trie x (children (tree (car lst)))))
		     (cdr lst)))
	      ((match? (key (car lst)) k)
	       (cons (branch k x (key (car lst)) (tree (car lst)))
		     (cdr lst)))
	      (else (cons (car lst) (ins (cdr lst) k x))))))
  (make-trie (value t) (ins (children t) k x)))
\end{lstlisting}

The match? function just test if two strings have common prefix.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (match? x y)
  (and (not (or (string-null? x) (string-null? y)))
       (string=? (string-car x) (string-car y))))
\end{lstlisting}

Function branch takes 4 parameters, the first key, the value to be
inserted, the second key, and the Patricia tree need to be branch
out. If will first find the longest common prefix of the two keys, If
it is equal to the first key, it means that the first key is the prefix of
the second key, we just create a new node with the value and chained
the Patricia tree by setting it as the only one child of this new
node; If the longest common prefix is equal to the second key, it
means that the second key is the prefix of the first key, we just
recursively insert the different part (the remove the prefix part)
into this Patricia tree; In other case, we just create a branch node
and set its two children, one is the leaf node with the value to be
inserted, the other is the Patricia tree passed as the fourth parameter.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (branch k1 x k2 t2) ;; returns (key tree)
  (let* ((k (lcp k1 k2))
	 (k1-new (string-tail k1 (string-length k)))
	 (k2-new (string-tail k2 (string-length k))))
    (cond ((string=? k1 k) ;; e.g. insert "an" into "another"
	   (make-child k (make-trie x (list (make-child k2-new t2)))))
	  ((string=? k2 k) ;; e.g. insert "another" into "an"
	   (make-child k (insert t2 k1-new x)))
	  (else (make-child k (make-trie
			       '()
			       (list (make-child k1-new (make-leaf x))
				     (make-child k2-new t2))))))))
\end{lstlisting}

Where the longest common prefix is extracted as the following.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (lcp x y)
  (let ((len (string-match-forward x y)))
    (string-head x len)))
\end{lstlisting}

We can reuse the list->trie and trie->string functions to test our
program.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (test-patricia)
  (define t (list->trie (list '("a" 1) '("an" 2) '("another" 7)
                        '("boy" 3) '("bool" 4) '("zoo" 3))))
  (define t2 (list->trie (list '("zoo" 3) '("bool" 4) '("boy" 3)
                         '("another" 7) '("an" 2) '("a" 1))))
  (display (trie->string t)) (newline)
  (display (trie->string t2)) (newline))
\end{lstlisting}

Evaluate this function will print t and t2 as below.

\begin{lstlisting}
(test-patricia)
(., (a1, (an2, (another7))), (bo., (bool4), (boy3)), (zoo3))
(., (a1, (an2, (another7))), (bo., (bool4), (boy3)), (zoo3))
\end{lstlisting}

% ================================================================
%                 Look up in Alphabetic Patrica Tree
% ================================================================
\subsection{Look up in alphabetic Patricia tree}
Different with Trie, we can't take each character from the key to look up.
We need check each child to see if it is a prefix of the key to be found.
If there is such a child, we then remove the prefix from
the key, and search this updated key in that child. if we can't find any
children as a prefix of the key, it means the looking up failed.

\subsubsection{Iterative look up algorithm for alphabetic Patricia tree}

This algorithm can be described in pseudo code as below.
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{PATRICIA-LOOK-UP}{$T, key$}
  \If{$T = NIL$}
     \State \Return $NIL$ \EndIf

  \Repeat
    \State $match \leftarrow FALSE$
    \For{each $i$ in $CHILDREN(T)$}
      \If{$key = KEY(i)$}
        \State \Return $VALUE(TREE(i))$
      \EndIf
      \If{$KEY(i)$ IS-PREFIX-OF $key$}
        \State $match \leftarrow TRUE$
        \State $key \leftarrow key$ subtract $KEY(i)$
        \State $T \leftarrow TREE(i)$
        \State break
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
  \Until{$match = FALSE$}
  \State \Return $NIL$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\subsubsection*{Look up in alphabetic Patrica Tree in C++}
In C++, we abstract the key type as a template parameter. By refer to
the KeyType defined in Patricia, we can get the support of implicitly
type conversion. If we can't find the key in a Patricia tree, the
below program returns default value of data type. One alternative is
to throw exception.

\lstset{language=C++}
\begin{lstlisting}
template<class K, class V>
V lookup(Patricia<K, V>* t, typename Patricia<K, V>::KeyType key){
  typedef typename Patricia<K, V>::Children::iterator Iterator;
  if(!t)
    return V(); //or throw exception
  for(;;){
    bool match(false);
    for(Iterator it=t->children.begin(); it!=t->children.end(); ++it){
      K k = it->first;
      if(key == k)
        return it->second->value;
      K prefix = lcp(key, k);
      if((!prefix.empty()) && k.empty()){
        match = true;
        t = it->second;
        break;
      }
    }
    if(!match)
      return V(); //or throw exception
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

To verify the look up program, we test it with the following simple
test cases.

\begin{lstlisting}
Patricia<std::string, int>* t(0);
const char* keys[] = {"a", "an", "another", "boy", "bool", "home"};
const int vals[] = {1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 4};
for(unsigned int i=0; i<sizeof(keys)/sizeof(char*); ++i)
  t = insert(t, keys[i], vals[i]);
std::cout<<"\nlookup another: "<<lookup(t, "another")
         <<"\nlookup boo: "<<lookup(t, "boo")
         <<"\nlookup boy: "<<lookup(t, "boy")
         <<"\nlookup by: "<<lookup(t, "by")
         <<"\nlookup boolean: "<<lookup(t, "boolean")<<"\n";
delete t;
\end{lstlisting}

This program will output the the result like below.

\begin{verbatim}
lookup another: 7
lookup boo: 0
lookup boy: 3
lookup by: 0
lookup boolean: 0
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Look up in alphabetic Patricia Tree in Python}
The implementation of looking up in Python is similar to the pseudo code.
Because Python don't support repeat-until loop directly, a while loop is
used instead.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
def lookup(t, key):
    if t is None:
        return None
    while(True):
        match = False
        for k, tr in t.children.items():
            if k == key:
                return tr.value
            (prefix, k1, k2) = lcp(key, k)
            if prefix != "" and k2 == "":
                match = True
                key = k1
                t = tr
                break
        if not match:
            return None
\end{lstlisting}

We can verify the looking up program as below.

\begin{lstlisting}
class PatriciaTest:
    # ...
    def test_lookup(self):
        t = map_to_patricia({"a":1, "an":2, "another":7, "b":1, "bob":3, \
                            "bool":4, "home":4})
        print "search t another", lookup(t, "another")
        print "search t boo", lookup(t, "boo")
        print "search t bob", lookup(t, "bob")
        print "search t boolean", lookup(t, "boolean")
\end{lstlisting}

The test result output in console is like the following.

\begin{verbatim}
search t another 7
search t boo None
search t bob 3
search t boolean None
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Recursive look up algorithm for alphabetic Patricia
tree}

To implement the look up recursively, we just look up among the children
of the Patricia tree.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{PATRICIA-LOOK-UP'}{$T, key$}
  \If{$T = NIL$}
    \State \Return $NIL$
  \Else
    \State \Return $FIND-IN-CHILDREN(CHILDREN(T), key)$
  \EndIf
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

The real recursion happens in FIND-IN-CHILDREN call, we pass the
children list as an argument. If it is not empty, we take first child,
and check if the prefix of this child is equal to the key; the value
of this child will be returned if they are same; if the prefix of the
child is just a prefix of the key, we recursively find in this child
with updated key.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{FIND-IN-CHILDREN}{$l, key$}
  \If{$l = NIL$}
    \State \Return $NIL$
  \ElsIf{$KEY(FIRST(l)) = key$}
    \State \Return $VALUE(FIRST(l))$
  \ElsIf{$KEY(FIRST(l))$ is prefix of $key$}
    \State $key \leftarrow key$ subtract $KEY(FIRST(l))$
    \State \Return $PATRICIA-LOOK-UP'(FIRST(l), key)$
  \Else
    \State \Return $FIND-IN-CHILDREN(REST(l), key)$
  \EndIf
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\subsubsection*{Look up in alphabetic Patrica Tree in Haskell}
In Haskell implementation, the above algorithm should be turned
into recursive way.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
-- lookup
import qualified Data.List

find :: Patricia a -> Key -> Maybe a
find t k = find' (children t) k where
    find' [] _ = Nothing
    find' (p:ps) k
          | (fst p) == k = value (snd p)
          | (fst p) `Data.List.isPrefixOf` k = find (snd p) (diff (fst p) k)
          | otherwise = find' ps k
    diff k1 k2 = drop (length (lcp k1 k2)) k2
\end{lstlisting}

When we search a given key in a Patricia tree, we recursively check each
of the child. If there are no children at all, we stop the recursion and
indicate a look up failure. In other case, we pick the prefix-node pair
one by one. If the prefix is as same as the given key, it means the target
node is found and the value of the node is returned. If the key has common
prefix with the child, the key will be updated by removing the longest
common prefix and we performs looking up recursively.

We can verify the above Haskell program with the following simple cases.

\begin{lstlisting}
testPatricia = "t1=" ++ (toString t1) ++ "\n" ++
               "find t1 another =" ++ (show (find t1 "another")) ++ "\n" ++
               "find t1 bo = " ++ (show (find t1 "bo")) ++ "\n" ++
               "find t1 boy = " ++ (show (find t1 "boy")) ++ "\n" ++
               "find t1 boolean = " ++ (show (find t1 "boolean"))
    where
      t1 = fromList [("a", 1), ("an", 2), ("another", 7), ("boy", 3),
           ("bool", 4), ("zoo", 3)]

main = do
  putStrLn testPatricia
\end{lstlisting}

The output is as below.

\begin{verbatim}
t1=(, (a:1, (an:2, (another:7))), (bo, (bool:4), (boy:3)), (zoo:3))
find t1 another =Just 7
find t1 bo = Nothing
find t1 boy = Just 3
find t1 boolean = Nothing
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection*{Look up in alphabetic Patricia Tree in Scheme/Lisp}

The Scheme/Lisp program is given as the following. The function
delegate the looking up to an inner function which will check each
child to see if the key binding to the child match the string we are
looking for.

\lstset{language=lisp}
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (lookup t k)
  (define (find lst k) ;; lst, [(k patricia)]
    (if (null? lst) '()
	(cond ((string=? (key (car lst)) k) (value (tree (car lst))))
	      ((string-prefix? (key (car lst)) k)
	       (lookup (tree (car lst))
		     (string-tail k (string-length (key (car lst))))))
	      (else (find (cdr lst) k)))))
  (find (children t) k))
\end{lstlisting}

In order to verify this program, some simple test cases are given to
search in the Patricia we created in previous section.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (test-patricia)
  (define t (list->trie (list '("a" 1) '("an" 2) '("another" 7)
                        '("boy" 3) '("bool" 4) '("zoo" 3))))
  (display (trie->string t)) (newline)
  (display "lookup another: ") (display (lookup t "another")) (newline)
  (display "lookup bo: ") (display (lookup t "bo")) (newline)
  (display "lookup boy: ") (display (lookup t "boy")) (newline)
  (display "lookup by: ") (display (lookup t "by")) (newline)
  (display "lookup boolean: ") (display (lookup t "boolean")) (newline))
\end{lstlisting}

This program will output the same result as the Haskell one.

\begin{lstlisting}
(test-patricia)
(., (a1, (an2, (another7))), (bo., (bool4), (boy3)), (zoo3))
lookup another: 7
lookup bo: ()
lookup boy: 3
lookup by: ()
lookup boolean: ()
\end{lstlisting}

%                 Trie and Patrica used in Industry
% ================================================================
\section{Trie and Patricia used in Industry}
Trie and Patricia are widely used in software industry. Integer based
Patricia tree is widely used in compiler. Some daily
used software has very interesting features can be realized with
Trie and Patricia. In the following sections, I'll list some of them,
including, e-dictionary, word auto-completion, t9 input method etc.
The commercial implementation typically doesn't adopt Trie or Patricia
directly. However, Trie and Patricia can be shown as a kind of
example realization.

\subsection{e-dictionary and word auto-completion}
Figure \ref{fig:e-dict} shows a screen shot of an English-Chinese dictionary.
In order to provide good user experience, when user input something,
the dictionary will search its word library, and list all candidate words and
phrases similar to what user have entered.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
       \begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/ciba.eps}
        \caption{e-dictionary. All candidates starting with what user input are listed.}
        \label{fig:e-dict}
       \end{center}
\end{figure}

Typically such dictionary contains hundreds of thousands words, performs a whole
word search is expensive. Commercial software adopts complex approach, including
caching, indexing etc to speed up this process.

Similar with e-dictionary, figure \ref{fig:word-completion} shows a popular
Internet search engine, when user input something, it will provide a candidate
lists, with all items start with what user has entered. And these candidates
are shown in an order of popularity. The more people search for a word, the
upper position it will be shown in the list.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
       \begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/adaptive-input.eps}
        \caption{Search engine. All candidates key words starting with what user input are listed.}
        \label{fig:word-completion}
       \end{center}
\end{figure}

In both case, we say the software provide a kind of word auto-completion support.
In some modern IDE, the editor can even helps user to auto-complete programmings.

In this section, I'll show a very simple implementation of e-dictionary with Trie
and Patricia.
To simplify the problem, let us assume the dictionary only support English - English
information.

Typically, a dictionary contains a lot of key-value pairs, the keys are English
words or phrases, and the relative values are the meaning of the words.

We can store all words and their meanings to a Trie, the drawback for this
approach is that it isn't space effective. We'll use Patricia as alternative
later on.

As an example, when user want to look up 'a', the dictionary does not only
return the meaning of then English word 'a', but also provide a list of
candidate words, which are all start with 'a', including 'abandon', 'about',
'accent', 'adam', ... Of course all these words are stored in Trie.

If there are too many candidates, one solution is only display the top 10
words for the user, and if he like, he can browse more.

Below pseudo code reuse the looking up program in previous sections and
Expand all potential top N candidates.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{TRIE-LOOK-UP-TOP-N}{$T, key, N$}
  \State $p \leftarrow TRIE-LOOK-UP'(T, key)$
  \State \Return $EXPAND-TOP-N(p, key, N)$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

Note that we should modify the TRIE-LOOK-UP a bit, instead of return
the value of the node, TRIE-LOOK-UP' returns the node itself.

Another alternative is to use Patricia instead of Trie. It can save much
spaces.

\subsubsection{Iterative algorithm of search top N candidate in Patricia}

The algorithm is similar to the Patricia look up one, but when we found
a node which key start from the string we are looking for, we expand
all its children until we get N candidates.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{PATRICIA-LOOK-UP-TOP-N}{$T, key, N$}
  \If{$T = NIL$}
     \State \Return $NIL$ \EndIf

  \State $prefix \leftarrow NIL$
  \Repeat
    \State $match \leftarrow FALSE$
    \For{each $i$ in $CHILDREN(T)$}
      \If{$key$ is prefix of $KEY(i)$}
        \State \Return $EXPAND-TOP-N(TREE(i), prefix, N)$
      \EndIf
      \If{$KEY(i)$ is prefix of $key$}
        \State $match \leftarrow TRUE$
        \State $key \leftarrow key$ subtract $KEY(i)$
        \State $T \leftarrow TREE(i)$
        \State $prefix \leftarrow prefix + KEY(i)$
        \State break
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
  \Until{$match = FALSE$}
  \State \Return $NIL$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\subsubsection*{An e-dictionary in Python}
In Python implementation, a function trie\_lookup is provided to perform
search all top N candidate started with a given string.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
def trie_lookup(t, key, n):
    if t is None:
        return None

    p = t
    for c in key:
        if not c in p.children:
            return None
        p=p.children[c]
    return expand(key, p, n)

def expand(prefix, t, n):
    res = []
    q = [(prefix, t)]
    while len(res)<n and len(q)>0:
        (s, p) = q.pop(0)
        if p.value is not None:
            res.append((s, p.value))
        for k, tr in p.children.items():
            q.append((s+k, tr))
    return res
\end{lstlisting}

Compare with the Trie look up function, the first part of this program is almost
same. The difference part is after we successfully located the node
which matches the key, all sub trees are expanded from this node in a
bread-first search manner, and the top n candidates are returned.

This program can be verified by below simple test cases.

\begin{lstlisting}
class LookupTest:
    def __init__(self):
        dict = {"a":"the first letter of English", \
           "an":"...same dict as in Haskell example"}
        self.tt = trie.map_to_trie(dict)

    def run(self):
        self.test_trie_lookup()

    def test_trie_lookup(self):
        print "test lookup top 5"
        print "search a ", trie_lookup(self.tt, "a", 5)
        print "search ab ", trie_lookup(self.tt, "ab", 5)
\end{lstlisting}

The test will output the following result.

\begin{verbatim}
test lookup to 5
search a  [('a', 'the first letter of English'), ('an', "used instead of 'a'
when the following word begins with a vowel sound"), ('adam', 'a character in
the Bible who was the first man made by God'), ('about', 'on the subject of;
connected with'), ('abandon', 'to leave a place, thing or person forever')]
search ab  [('about', 'on the subject of; connected with'), ('abandon', 'to
leave a place, thing or person forever')]
\end{verbatim}

To save the spaces, we can also implement such a dictionary search by using
Patricia.

\begin{lstlisting}
def patricia_lookup(t, key, n):
    if t is None:
        return None
    prefix = ""
    while(True):
        match = False
        for k, tr in t.children.items():
            if string.find(k, key) == 0: #is prefix of
                return expand(prefix+k, tr, n)
            if string.find(key, k) ==0:
                match = True
                key = key[len(k):]
                t = tr
                prefix += k
                break
        if not match:
            return None
\end{lstlisting}

In this program, we called Python string class to test if a string x is
prefix of a string y. In case we locate a node with the key we are looking
up is either equal of as prefix of the this sub tree, we expand it till
we find n candidates. Function expand() can be reused here.

We can test this program with the very same test cases and the results are
identical to the previous one.

\subsubsection*{An e-dictionary in C++}

In C++ implementation, we overload the look up function by providing an
extra integer n to indicate we want to search top n candidates. the
result is a list of key-value pairs,

\lstset{language=C++}
\begin{lstlisting}
//lookup top n candidate with prefix key in Trie
template<class K, class V>
std::list<std::pair<K, V> > lookup(Trie<K, V>* t,
                                   typename Trie<K, V>::KeyType key,
                                   unsigned int n)
{
  typedef std::list<std::pair<K, V> > Result;
  if(!t)
    return Result();

  Trie<K, V>* p(t);
  for(typename K::iterator it=key.begin(); it!=key.end(); ++it){
    if(p->children.find(*it) == p->children.end())
      return Result();
    p = p->children[*it];
  }
  return expand(key, p, n);
}
\end{lstlisting}

The program is almost same as the Trie looking up one, except it will
call expand function when it located the node with the key. Function
expand is as the following.

\begin{lstlisting}
template<class T>
std::list<std::pair<typename T::KeyType, typename T::ValueType> >
expand(typename T::KeyType prefix, T* t, unsigned int n)
{
  typedef typename T::KeyType KeyType;
  typedef typename T::ValueType ValueType;
  typedef std::list<std::pair<KeyType, ValueType> > Result;

  Result res;
  std::queue<std::pair<KeyType, T*> > q;
  q.push(std::make_pair(prefix, t));
  while(res.size()<n && (!q.empty())){
    std::pair<KeyType, T*> i = q.front();
    KeyType s = i.first;
    T* p = i.second;
    q.pop();
    if(p->value != ValueType()){
      res.push_back(std::make_pair(s, p->value));
    }
    for(typename T::Children::iterator it = p->children.begin();
        it!=p->children.end(); ++it)
      q.push(std::make_pair(s+it->first, it->second));
  }
  return res;
}
\end{lstlisting}

This function use a bread-first search approach to expand top N
candidates, it maintain a queue to store the node it is currently
dealing with. Each time the program picks a candidate node from the
queue, expands all its children and put them to the queue. the program
will terminate when the queue is empty or we have already found N
candidates.

Function expand is generic we'll use it in later sections.

Then we can provide a helper function to convert the candidate
list to readable string. Note that this list is actually a list of pairs so we can
provide a generic function.

\begin{lstlisting}
//list of pairs to string
template<class Container>
std::string lop_to_str(Container coll){
  typedef typename Container::iterator Iterator;
  std::ostringstream s;
  s<<"[";
  for(Iterator it=coll.begin(); it!=coll.end(); ++it)
    s<<"("<<it->first<<", "<<it->second<<"), ";
  s<<"]";
  return s.str();
}
\end{lstlisting}

After that, we can test the program with some simple test cases.

\begin{lstlisting}
Trie<std::string, std::string>* t(0);
const char* dict[] = {
  "a", "the first letter of English", \
  "an", "used instead of 'a' when the following word begins with a vowel sound", \
  "another", "one more person or thing or an extra amount", \
  "abandon", "to leave a place, thing or person forever", \
  "about", "on the subject of; connected with", \
  "adam", "a character in the Bible who was the first man made by God", \
  "boy", "a male child or, more generally, a male of any age", \
  "body", "the whole physical structure that forms a person or animal", \
  "zoo", "an area in which animals, especially wild animals, are kept" \
         "so that people can go and look at them, or study them"};

const char** first=dict;
const char** last =dict + sizeof(dict)/sizeof(char*);
for(;first!=last; ++first, ++first)
  t = insert(t, *first, *(first+1));
}

std::cout<<"test lookup top 5 in Trie\n"
         <<"search a "<<lop_to_str(lookup(t, "a", 5))<<"\n"
         <<"search ab "<<lop_to_str(lookup(t, "ab", 5))<<"\n";
delete t;
\end{lstlisting}

The result print to the console is something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
test lookup top 5 in Trie
search a [(a, the first letter of English), (an, used instead of 'a'
when the following word begins with a vowel sound), (adam, a character
in the Bible who was the first man made by God), (about, on the
subject of; connected with), (abandon, to leave a place, thing or
person forever), ]
search ab [(about, on the subject of; connected with), (abandon, to
leave a place, thing or person forever), ]
\end{verbatim}

To save the the space with Patricia, we provide a C++ program to
search top N candidate as below.

\begin{lstlisting}
template<class K, class V>
std::list<std::pair<K, V> > lookup(Patricia<K, V>* t,
                                   typename Patricia<K, V>::KeyType key,
                                   unsigned int n)
{
  typedef typename std::list<std::pair<K, V> > Result;
  typedef typename Patricia<K, V>::Children::iterator Iterator;
  if(!t)
    return Result();
  K prefix;
  for(;;){
    bool match(false);
    for(Iterator it=t->children.begin(); it!=t->children.end(); ++it){
      K k(it->first);
      if(is_prefix_of(key, k))
        return expand(prefix+k, it->second, n);
      if(is_prefix_of(k, key)){
        match = true;
        prefix += k;
        lcp<K>(key, k); //update key
        t = it->second;
        break;
      }
    }
    if(!match)
      return Result();
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The program iterate all children if the string we are looked up is
prefix of one child, we expand this child to find top N candidates; If
the in the opposite case, we update the string and go on examine into
this child Patricia tree.

Where the function is\_prefix\_of() is defined as below.

\begin{lstlisting}
// x `is prefix of` y?
template<class T>
bool is_prefix_of(T x, T y){
  if(x.size()<=y.size())
    return std::equal(x.begin(), x.end(), y.begin());
  return false;
}
\end{lstlisitng}

We use STL equal function to check if x is prefix of y.

The test case is nearly same as the one in Trie.

\begin{lstlisting}
Patricia<std::string, std::string>* t(0);
const char* dict[] = {
  "a", "the first letter of English", \
  "an", "used instead of 'a' when the following word begins with a vowel sound", \
  "another", "one more person or thing or an extra amount", \
  "abandon", "to leave a place, thing or person forever", \
  "about", "on the subject of; connected with", \
  "adam", "a character in the Bible who was the first man made by God", \
  "boy", "a male child or, more generally, a male of any age", \
  "body", "the whole physical structure that forms a person or animal", \
  "zoo", "an area in which animals, especially wild animals, are kept" \
         "so that people can go and look at them, or study them"};

const char** first=dict;
const char** last =dict + sizeof(dict)/sizeof(char*);
for(;first!=last; ++first, ++first)
  t = insert(t, *first, *(first+1));
}

std::cout<<"test lookup top 5 in Trie\n"
         <<"search a "<<lop_to_str(lookup(t, "a", 5))<<"\n"
         <<"search ab "<<lop_to_str(lookup(t, "ab", 5))<<"\n";
delete t;
\end{lstlisting}

This test case will output a very same result in console.

\subsubsection{Recursive algorithm of search top N candidate in
  Patricia}

This algorithm can also be implemented recursively, if the string we
are looking for is empty, we expand all children until we get N
candidates. else we recursively examine the children of the node to
see if we can find one has prefix as this string.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{PATRICIA-LOOK-UP-TOP-N}{$T, key, N$}
  \If{$T = NIL$}
    \State \Return $NIL$
  \EndIf

  \If{$KEY = NIL$}
    \State \Return $EXPAND-TOP-N(T, NIL, N)$
  \Else
    \State \Return $FIND-IN-CHILDREN-TOP-N(CHILDREN(T), key, N)$
  \EndIf
\EndFunction

\Function{FIND-IN-CHILDREN-TOP-N}{$l, key, N$}
  \If{$l = NIL$}
    \State \Return $NIL$
  \ElsIf{$KEY(FIRST(l)) = key$}

  \EndIf
\EndFunction

\subsubsection*{An e-dictionary in Haskell}
In Haskell implementation, we provide a function named as findAll.
Thanks for the lazy evaluation support, findAll won't produce all candidates
words until we need them. we can use something like 'take 10 findAll'
to get the top 10 words easily.

findAll is given as the following.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
findAll:: Trie a -> String -> [(String, a)]
findAll t [] =
    case value t of
      Nothing -> enum (children t)
      Just x  -> ("", x):(enum (children t))
    where
      enum [] = []
      enum (p:ps) = (mapAppend (fst p) (findAll (snd p) [])) ++ (enum ps)
findAll t (k:ks) =
    case lookup k (children t) of
      Nothing -> []
      Just t' -> mapAppend k (findAll t' ks)

mapAppend x lst = map (\p->(x:(fst p), (snd p))) lst
\end{lstlisting}

function findAll take a Trie, a word to be looked up, it will output
a list of pairs, the first element of the pair is the candidate word,
the second element of the pair is the meaning of the word.

Compare with the find function of Trie, the none-trivial case is very similar.
We take a letter form the words to be looked up, if there is no child starting
with this letter, the program returns empty list. If there is such a child
starting with this letter, this child should be a candidate. We use function
mapAppend to add this letter in front of all elements of recursively founded
candidate words.

In case we consumed all letters, we next returns all potential words, which
means the program will traverse all children of the current node.

Note that only the node with value field not equal to 'None' is a meaningful
word in our dictionary. We need append the list with the right meaning.

With this function, we can construct a very simple dictionary and return
top 5 candidate to user. Here is the test program.

\begin{lstlisting}
testFindAll = "\nlook up a: " ++ (show $ take 5 $findAll t "a") ++
              "\nlook up ab: " ++ (show $ take 5 $findAll t "ab")
    where
      t = fromList [
        ("a", "the first letter of English"),
        ("an", "used instead of 'a' when the following word begins with"
               "a vowel sound"),
        ("another", "one more person or thing or an extra amount"),
        ("abandon", "to leave a place, thing or person forever"),
        ("about", "on the subject of; connected with"),
        ("adam", "a character in the Bible who was the first man made by God"),
        ("boy", "a male child or, more generally, a male of any age"),
        ("body", "the whole physical structure that forms a person or animal"),
        ("zoo", "an area in which animals, especially wild animals, are kept"
                " so that people can go and look at them, or study them")]

main = do
    putStrLn testFindAll
\end{lstlisting}

This program will out put a result like this:
\begin{verbatim}
look up a: [("a","the first letter of English"),("an","used instead of 'a'
when the following word begins with a vowel sound"),("another","one more
person or thing or an extra amount"),("abandon","to leave a place, thing
or person forever"),("about","on the subject of; connected with")]
look up ab: [("abandon","to leave a place, thing or person forever"),
("about","on the subject of; connected with")]
\end{verbatim}

The Trie solution wasts a lot of spaces. It is very easy to improve the above
program with Patricia. Below source code shows the Patricia approach.

\begin{lstlisting}
findAll' :: Patricia a -> Key -> [(Key, a)]
findAll' t [] =
    case value t of
      Nothing -> enum $ children t
      Just x  -> ("", x):(enum $ children t)
    where
      enum [] = []
      enum (p:ps) = (mapAppend' (fst p) (findAll' (snd p) [])) ++ (enum ps)
findAll' t k = find' (children t) k where
    find' [] _ = []
    find' (p:ps) k
          | (fst p) == k
              = mapAppend' k (findAll' (snd p) [])
          | (fst p) `Data.List.isPrefixOf` k
              = mapAppend' (fst p) (findAll' (snd p) (k `diff` (fst p)))
          | k `Data.List.isPrefixOf` (fst p)
              = findAll' (snd p) []
          | otherwise = find' ps k
    diff x y = drop (length y) x

mapAppend' s lst = map (\p->(s++(fst p), snd p)) lst
\end{lstlisting}

If compare this program with the one implemented by Trie, we can find they are
very similar to each other. In none-trivial case, we just examine each child
to see if any one match the key to be looked up. If one child is exactly equal
to the key, we then expand all its sub branches and put them to the candidate list.
If the child correspond to a prefix of the key, the program goes on find the
the rest part of the key along this child and concatenate this prefix to all
later results. If the current key is prefix to a child, the program will traverse
this child and return all its sub branches as candidate list.

This program can be tested with the very same case as above, and it will output
the same result.

\subsubsection*{An e-dictionary in Scheme/Lisp}

In Scheme/Lisp implementation with Trie, a function named find is used
to search all candidates start with a given string. If the string is
empty, the program will enumerate all sub trees as result; else the
program calls an inner function find-child to search a child which
matches the first character of the given string. Then the program
recursively apply the find function to this child with the rest
characters of the string to be searched.

\lstset{language=lisp}
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (find t k)
  (define (find-child lst k)
    (tree (find-matching-item lst (lambda (c) (string=? (key c) k)))))
  (if (string-null? k)
      (enumerate t)
      (let ((t-new (find-child (children t) (string-car k))))
	(if (null? t-new) '()
	  (map-string-append (string-car k) (find t-new (string-cdr k)))))))
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the map-string-append will insert the first character to all
the elements (more accurately, each element is a pair with a key and a
value, map-string-append insert the character in front of each key) in
the result returned by recursive call. It is defined like this.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (map-string-append x lst) ;; lst: [(key value)]
  (map (lambda (p) (cons (string-append x (car p)) (cdr p))) lst))
\end{lstlisting}

The enumerate function which can expend all sub trees is implemented
as the following.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (enumerate t) ;; enumerate all sub trees
  (if (null? t) '()
      (let ((res (append-map
		  (lambda (p)(map-string-append (key p)(enumerate (tree p))))
		  (children t))))
	(if (null? (value t)) res
	    (cons (cons "" (value t)) res)))))
\end{lstlisting}

The test case is a very simple list of word-meaning pairs.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define dict
  (list '("a" "the first letter of English")
	'("an" "used instead of 'a' when the following word begins with a vowel sound")
	'("another" "one more person or thing or an extra amount")
	'("abandon" "to leave a place, thing or person forever")
	'("about" "on the subject of; connected with")
	'("adam" "a character in the Bible who was the first man made by God")
	'("boy" "a male child or, more generally, a male of any age")
	'("body" "the whole physical structure that forms a person or animal")
	'("zoo" "an area in which animals, especially wild animals,
  are kept so that people can go and look at them, or study them")))
\end{lstlisting}

After feed this dict to a Trie, if user tries to find 'a*' or 'ab*'
like below.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (test-trie-find-all)
  (define t (list->trie dict))
  (display "find a*: ") (display (find t "a")) (newline)
  (display "find ab*: ") (display (find t "ab")) (newline))
\end{lstlisting}

The result is a list with all candidates start with the given string.
\begin{verbatim}
(test-trie-find-all)
find a*: ((a . the first letter of English) (an . used instead of 'a'
when the following word begins with a vowel sound) (another . one more
person or thing or an extra amount) (abandon . to leave a place, thing
or person forever) (about . on the subject of; connected with) (adam
. a character in the Bible who was the first man made by God))
find ab*: ((abandon . to leave a place, thing or person forever)
(about . on the subject of; connected with))
\end{verbatim}

Trie approach isn't space effective. Patricia can be one alternative
to improve in terms of space.

We can fully reuse the function enumerate, map-string-append which are
defined for trie. the find function for Patricia is implemented as the
following.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (find t k)
  (define (find-child lst k)
    (if (null? lst) '()
	(cond ((string=? (key (car lst)) k)
	       (map-string-append k (enumerate (tree (car lst)))))
	      ((string-prefix? (key (car lst)) k)
	       (let ((k-new (string-tail k (string-length (key (car lst))))))
		 (map-string-append (key (car lst)) (find (tree (car lst)) k-new))))
	      ((string-prefix? k (key (car lst))) (enumerate (tree (car lst))))
	      (else (find-child (cdr lst) k)))))
  (if (string-null? k)
      (enumerate t)
      (find-child (children t) k)))
\end{lstlisting}

If the same test cases of search all candidates of 'a*' and 'ab*' are
fed we can get a very same result.

\subsection{T9 input method}
Most mobile phones around year 2000 has a key pad. To edit a short message/email
with such key-pad, users typically have quite different experience from PC.
Because a mobile-phone key pad, or so called ITU-T key pad has few keys.
Figure {fig:itut-keypad} shows an example.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
       \begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/itu-t.eps}
        \caption{an ITU-T keypad for mobile phone.}
        \label{fig:itut-keypad}
       \end{center}
\end{figure}

There are typical 2 methods to input an English word/phrase with ITU-T key pad.
For instance, if user wants to enter a word ``home'', He can press the key
in below sequence.

\begin{itemize}
\item Press key '4' twice to enter the letter 'h';
\item Press key '6' three times to enter the letter 'o';
\item Press key '6' twice to enter the letter 'm';
\item Press key '3' twice to enter the letter 'e';
\end{itemize}

Another high efficient way is to simplify the key press sequence like the
following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Press key '4', '6', '6', '3', word ``home'' appears on top of the candidate list;
\item Press key '*' to change a candidate word, so word ``good'' appears;
\item Press key '*' again to change another candidate word, next word ``gone'' appears;
\item ...
\end{itemize}

Compare these 2 method, we can see method 2 is much easier for the end user, and
it is operation efficient. The only overhead is to store a candidate words dictionary.

Method 2 is called as T9 input method, or predictive input method
\cite{wiki-t9}, \cite {wiki-predictive-text}. The abbreviation 'T9' stands
for 'textonym'. In this section, I'll show an example implementation of T9
by using Trie and Patricia.

In order to provide candidate words to user, a dictionary must be prepared
in advance. Trie or Patricia can be used to store the Dictionary. In the real
commercial software, complex indexing dictionary is used. We show the very
simple Trie and Patricia only for illustration purpose.

\subsubsection{Iterative algorithm of T9 looking up}

Below pseudo code shows how to realize T9 with Trie.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{TRIE-LOOK-UP-T9}{$T, key$}
  \State $PUSH-BACK(Q, NIL, key, T)$
  \State $r \leftarrow NIL$
  \While{$Q$ is not empty}
    \State $p, k, t \leftarrow POP-FRONT(Q)$
    \State $i \leftarrow FIRST-LETTER(k)$
    \For{each $c$ in $T9-MAPPING(i)$}
      \If{$c$ is in $CHILDREN(t)$}
        \State $k' \leftarrow k$ subtract $i$
        \If{$k'$ is empty}
          \State $APPEND(r, p+c)$
        \Else
          \State $PUSH-BACK(Q, p+c, k', CHILDREN(t)[c])$
        \EndIf
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
  \EndWhile
  \State \Return $r$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

This is actually a bread-first search program. It utilizes a queue to store
the current node and key string we are examining. The algorithm takes the first
digit from the key, looks up it in T9 mapping to get all English letters
corresponding to this digit. For each letter, if it can be found in the children
of current node, the node along with the English string found so far are
push back to the queue. In case all digits are examined, a candidate is found.
We'll append this candidate to the result list. The loop will terminate when
the queue is empty.

Since Trie is not space effective, minor modification of the above program can
work with Patricia, which can help to save extra spaces.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{PATRICIA-LOOK-UP-T9}{$T, key$}
  \State $PUSH-BACK(Q, NIL, key, T)$
  \State $r \leftarrow NIL$
  \While{$Q$ is not empty}
    \State $p, k, t \leftarrow POP-FRONT(Q)$
    \For{each $child$ in $CHILDREN(t)$}
      \State $k' \leftarrow CONVERT-T9(KEY(child))$
      \If{$k'$ IS-PREFIX-OF $k$}
        \If{$k' = k$}
          \State $APPEND(r, p+KEY(child))$
        \Else
          \State $PUSH-BACK(Q, p+KEY(child), k-k', child)$
        \EndIf
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
  \EndWhile
  \State \Return $r$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\subsubsection*{T9 implementation in Python}

In Python implementation, T9 looking up is realized in a typical bread-first search algorithm as the following.

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
T9MAP={'2':"abc", '3':"def", '4':"ghi", '5':"jkl", \
       '6':"mno", '7':"pqrs", '8':"tuv", '9':"wxyz"}

def trie_lookup_t9(t, key):
    if t is None or key == "":
        return None
    q = [("", key, t)]
    res = []
    while len(q)>0:
        (prefix, k, t) = q.pop(0)
        i=k[0]
        if not i in T9MAP:
            return None #invalid input
        for c in T9MAP[i]:
            if c in t.children:
                if k[1:]=="":
                    res.append((prefix+c, t.children[c].value))
                else:
                    q.append((prefix+c, k[1:], t.children[c]))
    return res
\end{lstlisting}

Function trie\_lookup\_t9 check if the parameters are valid first. Then
it push the initial data into a queue. The program repeatedly pop the item
from the queue, including what node it will examine next, the number sequence
string, and the alphabetic string it has been searched.

For each popped item, the program takes the next digit from the number
sequence, and looks up in T9 map to find the corresponding English letters.
With all these letters, if they can be found in the children of the current
node, we'll push this child along with the updated number sequence string
and updated alphabetic string into the queue. In case we process all
numbers, we find a candidate result.

We can verify the above program with the following test cases.

\begin{lstlisting}
class LookupTest:
    def __init__(self):
        t9dict = ["home", "good", "gone", "hood", "a", "another", "an"]
        self.t9t = trie.list_to_trie(t9dict)

    def test_trie_t9(self):
        print "search 4 ", trie_lookup_t9(self.t9t, "4")
        print "search 46 ", trie_lookup_t9(self.t9t, "46")
        print "search 4663 ", trie_lookup_t9(self.t9t, "4663")
        print "search 2 ", trie_lookup_t9(self.t9t, "2")
        print "search 22 ", trie_lookup_t9(self.t9t, "22")
\end{lstlisting}

If we run the test, it will output a very same result as the above Haskell
program.

\begin{verbatim}
search 4  [('g', None), ('h', None)]
search 46  [('go', None), ('ho', None)]
search 4663  [('gone', None), ('good', None), ('home', None), ('hood', None)]
search 2  [('a', None)]
search 22  []
\end{verbatim}

To save the spaces, Patricia can be used instead of Trie.

\begin{lstlisting}
def patricia_lookup_t9(t, key):
    if t is None or key == "":
        return None
    q = [("", key, t)]
    res = []
    while len(q)>0:
        (prefix, key, t) = q.pop(0)
        for k, tr in t.children.items():
            digits = toT9(k)
            if string.find(key, digits)==0: #is prefix of
                if key == digits:
                    res.append((prefix+k, tr.value))
                else:
                    q.append((prefix+k, key[len(k):], tr))
    return res
\end{lstlisting}

Compare to the implementation with Trie, they are very similar. We also
used a bread-first search approach. The different part is that we convert
the string of each child to number sequence string according to T9 mapping.
if it is prefix of the key we are looking for, we push this child along with
updated key and prefix. In case we examined all digits, we find a candidate
result.

The convert function is a reverse mapping process as below.
\begin{lstlisting}
def toT9(s):
    res=""
    for c in s:
        for k, v in T9MAP.items():
            if string.find(v, c)>=0:
                res+=k
                break
        #error handling skipped.
    return res
\end{lstlisting}

For illustration purpose, the error handling for invalid letters is skipped.
If we feed the program with the same test cases, we can get a result as the
following.

\begin{verbatim}
search 4  []
search 46  [('go', None), ('ho', None)]
search 466  []
search 4663  [('good', None), ('gone', None), ('home', None), ('hood', None)]
search 2  [('a', None)]
search 22  []
\end{verbatim}

The result is slightly different from the one output by Trie. The reason is
as same as what we analyzed in Haskell implementation. It is easily to modify
the program to output a similar result.

\subsubsection*{T9 implemented in C++}

First we define T9 mapping as a Singleton object, this is because we
want to it can be used both in Trie look up and Patricia look up programs.

\lstset{language=C++}
\begin{lstlisting}
struct t9map{
  typedef std::map<char, std::string> Map;
  Map map;

  t9map(){
    map['2']="abc";
    map['3']="def";
    map['4']="ghi";
    map['5']="jkl";
    map['6']="mno";
    map['7']="pqrs";
    map['8']="tuv";
    map['9']="wxyz";
  }

  static t9map& inst(){
    static t9map i;
    return i;
  }
};
\end{lstlisting}

Note in other languages or keypad layout, we can define different
mappings and pass them as an argument to the looking up function.

With this mapping, the looking up in Trie can be given as
below. Although we want to keep the genericity of the program, for
illustration purpose, we just simply use the t9 mapping directly.

In order to keep the code as short as possible, a boost library tool,
boost::tuple is used. For more about boost::tuple, please refer to \cite{boost-book}.

\begin{lstlisting}
template<class K, class V>
std::list<std::pair<K, V> > lookup_t9(Trie<K, V>* t,
				      typename Trie<K, V>::KeyType key)
{
  typedef std::list<std::pair<K, V> > Result;
  typedef typename Trie<K, V>::KeyType Key;
  typedef typename Trie<K, V>::Char Char;

  if((!t) || key.empty())
    return Result();

  Key prefix;
  std::map<Char, Key> m = t9map::inst().map;
  std::queue<boost::tuple<Key, Key, Trie<K, V>*> > q;
  q.push(boost::make_tuple(prefix, key, t));
  Result res;
  while(!q.empty()){
    boost::tie(prefix, key, t) = q.front();
    q.pop();
    Char c = *key.begin();
    key = Key(key.begin()+1, key.end());
    if(m.find(c) == m.end())
      return Result();
    Key cs = m[c];
    for(typename Key::iterator it=cs.begin(); it!=cs.end(); ++it)
      if(t->children.find(*it)!=t->children.end()){
	if(key.empty())
	  res.push_back(std::make_pair(prefix+*it, t->children[*it]->value));
	else
	  q.push(boost::make_tuple(prefix+*it, key, t->children[*it]));
      }
  }
  return res;
}
\end{lstlisting}

This program will first check if the Patricia tree or the key are
empty to deal with with trivial case. It next initialize a queue, and
push one tuple to it. the tuple contains 3 elements, a prefix to
represent a string the program has been searched, current key it need
look up, and a node it will examine.

Then the program repeatedly pops the tuple from the queue, takes the
first character from the key, and looks up in T9 map to get a
candidate English letter list. With each letter in this list, the
program examine if it exists in the children of current node. In case
it find such a child, if there is no left letter to look up, it means
we found a candidate result, we push it to the result list. Else, we
create a new tuple with updated prefix, key and this child; the push
it to the queue for later process.

Below are some simple test cases for verification.

\begin{lstlisting}
Trie<std::string, std::string>* t9trie(0);
const char* t9dict[] = {"home", "good", "gone", "hood", "a", "another", "an"};
t9trie = list_to_trie(t9dict, t9dict+sizeof(t9dict)/sizeof(char*), t9trie);
std::cout<<"test t9 lookup in Trie\n"
         <<"search 4 "<<lop_to_str(lookup_t9(t9trie, "4"))<<"\n"
	 <<"serach 46 "<<lop_to_str(lookup_t9(t9trie, "46"))<<"\n"
	 <<"serach 4663 "<<lop_to_str(lookup_t9(t9trie, "4663"))<<"\n"
	 <<"serach 2 "<<lop_to_str(lookup_t9(t9trie, "2"))<<"\n"
	 <<"serach 22 "<<lop_to_str(lookup_t9(t9trie, "22"))<<"\n\n";
delete t9trie;
\end{lstlisting}

It will output the same result as the Python program.

\begin{verbatim}
test t9 lookup in Trie
search 4 [(g, ), (h, ), ]
serach 46 [(go, ), (ho, ), ]
serach 4663 [(gone, ), (good, ), (home, ), (hood, ), ]
serach 2 [(a, ), ]
serach 22 []
\end{verbatim}

In order to save space, a looking up program for Patricia is also
provided.

\begin{lstlisting}
template<class K, class V>
std::list<std::pair<K, V> > lookup_t9(Patricia<K, V>* t,
				      typename Patricia<K, V>::KeyType key)
{
  typedef std::list<std::pair<K, V> > Result;
  typedef typename Patricia<K, V>::KeyType Key;
  typedef typename Key::value_type Char;
  typedef typename Patricia<K, V>::Children::iterator Iterator;

  if((!t) || key.empty())
    return Result();

  Key prefix;
  std::map<Char, Key> m = t9map::inst().map;
  std::queue<boost::tuple<Key, Key, Patricia<K, V>*> > q;
  q.push(boost::make_tuple(prefix, key, t));
  Result res;
  while(!q.empty()){
    boost::tie(prefix, key, t) = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for(Iterator it=t->children.begin(); it!=t->children.end(); ++it){
      Key digits = t9map::inst().toT9(it->first);
      if(is_prefix_of(digits, key)){
	if(digits == key)
	  res.push_back(std::make_pair(prefix+it->first, it->second->value));
	else{
	  key =Key(key.begin()+it->first.size(), key.end());
	  q.push(boost::make_tuple(prefix+it->first, key, it->second));
	}
      }
    }
  }
  return res;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The program is similar to the one with Trie very much. This is a
typical bread-first search approach. Note that we added a member
function to\_t9() to convert a English word/phrase back to digit
number string. This member function is implemented as the following.

\begin{lstlisting}
struct t9map{
  //...
  std::string to_t9(std::string s){
    std::string res;
    for(std::string::iterator c=s.begin(); c!=s.end(); ++c){
      for(Map::iterator m=map.begin(); m!=map.end(); ++m){
	std::string val = m->second;
	if(std::find(val.begin(), val.end(), *c)!=val.end()){
	  res.push_back(m->first);
	  break;
	}
      }
    } // skip error handling.
    return res;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

The error handling for invalid letters is omitted in order to keep the
code short for easy understanding. We can use the very similar test
cases as above except we need change the Trie to Patrica. It will
output as below.

\begin{verbatim}
test t9 lookup in Patricia
search 4 []
serach 46 [(go, ), (ho, ), ]
serach 466 []
serach 4663 [(gone, ), (good, ), ]
serach 2 [(a, ), ]
serach 22 []
\end{verbatim}

The result is slightly different, please refer to the Haskell section
for the reason of this difference. It is very easy to modify the
program to output the very same result as Trie's one.

\subsubsection{Recursive algorithm of T9 looking up}

\subsubsection*{T9 implemented in Haskell}

In Haskell, we first define a map from key pad to English letter. When user
input a key pad number sequence, we take each number and check from the Trie.
All children match the number should be investigated. Below is a Haskell
program to realize T9 input.

\lstset{language=Haskell}
\begin{lstlisting}
mapT9 = [('2', "abc"), ('3', "def"), ('4', "ghi"), ('5', "jkl"),
         ('6', "mno"), ('7', "pqrs"), ('8', "tuv"), ('9', "wxyz")]

lookupT9 :: Char -> [(Char, b)] -> [(Char, b)]
lookupT9 c children = case lookup c mapT9 of
        Nothing -> []
        Just s  -> foldl f [] s where
             f lst x = case lookup x children of
                 Nothing -> lst
                 Just t  -> (x, t):lst

-- T9-find in Trie
findT9:: Trie a -> String -> [(String, Maybe a)]
findT9 t [] = [("", Trie.value t)]
findT9 t (k:ks) = foldl f [] (lookupT9 k (children t))
    where
      f lst (c, tr) = (mapAppend c (findT9 tr ks)) ++ lst
\end{lstlisting}

findT9 is the main function, it takes 2 parameters, a Trie and a number
sequence string. In non-trivial case, it calls lookupT9 function to
examine all children which match the first number.

For each matched child, the program recursively calls findT9 on it with
the left numbers, and we use mapAppend to insert the currently finding letter
in front of all results. The program use foldl to combine all these together.

Function lookupT9 is used to filtered all possible children who match a
number. It first call lookup function on mapT9, so that a string of possible
English letters can be identified. Next we call lookup for each candidate
letter to see if there is a child can match the letter. We use foldl to
collect all such child together.

This program can be verified by using some simple test cases.

\begin{lstlisting}
testFindT9 = "press 4: " ++ (show $ take 5 $ findT9 t "4")++
             "\npress 46: " ++ (show $ take 5 $ findT9 t "46")++
             "\npress 4663: " ++ (show $ take 5 $ findT9 t "4663")++
             "\npress 2: " ++ (show $ take 5 $ findT9 t "2")++
             "\npress 22: " ++ (show $ take 5 $ findT9 t "22")
    where
      t = Trie.fromList lst
      lst = [("home", 1), ("good", 2), ("gone", 3), ("hood", 4),
             ("a", 5), ("another", 6), ("an", 7)]
\end{lstlisting}

The program will output below result.

\begin{verbatim}
press 4: [("g",Nothing),("h",Nothing)]
press 46: [("go",Nothing),("ho",Nothing)]
press 4663: [("gone",Just 3),("good",Just 2),("home",Just 1),("hood",Just 4)]
press 2: [("a",Just 5)]
press 22: []
\end{verbatim}

The value of each child is just for illustration, we can put empty value instead
and only returns candidate keys for a real input application.

Tries consumes to many spaces, we can provide a Patricia version as alternative.

\begin{lstlisting}
findPrefixT9' :: String -> [(String, b)] -> [(String, b)]
findPrefixT9' s lst = filter f lst where
    f (k, _) = (toT9 k) `Data.List.isPrefixOf` s

toT9 :: String -> String
toT9 [] = []
toT9 (x:xs) = (unmapT9 x mapT9):(toT9 xs) where
    unmapT9 x (p:ps) = if x `elem` (snd p) then (fst p) else unmapT9 x ps

findT9' :: Patricia a -> String -> [(String, Maybe a)]
findT9' t [] = [("", value t)]
findT9' t k = foldl f [] (findPrefixT9' k (children t))
    where
      f lst (s, tr) = (mapAppend' s (findT9' tr (k `diff` s))) ++ lst
      diff x y = drop (length y) x
\end{lstlisting}

In this program, we don't check one digit at a time, we take all the digit
sequence, and we examine all children of the Patricia node. For each child,
the program convert the prefix string to number sequence by using function
toT9, if the result is prefix of what user input, we go on search in this
child and append the prefix in front of all further results.

If we tries the same test case, we can find the result is a bit different.

\begin{verbatim}
press 4: []
press 46: [("go",Nothing),("ho",Nothing)]
press 466: []
press 4663: [("good",Just 2),("gone",Just 3),("home",Just 1),("hood",Just 4)]
press 2: [("a",Just 5)]
press 22: []
\end{verbatim}

If user press key '4', because the dictionary (represent by Patricia) doesn't
contain any candidates matches it, user will get an empty candidates list.
The same situation happens when he enters ``466''. In real input method
implementation, such user experience isn't good, because it displays nothing
although user presses the key several times. One improvement is to
predict what user will input next by display a partial result. This can be
easily achieved by modify the above program. (Hint: not only check
\begin{lstlisting}
findPrefixT9' s lst = filter f lst where
    f (k, _) = (toT9 k) `Data.List.isPrefixOf` s
\end{lstlisting}
but also check
\begin{lstlisting}
    f (k, _) = s `Data.List.isPrefixOf` (toT9 k)
\end{lstlisting}
)

\subsubsection*{T9 implemented in Scheme/Lisp}

In Scheme/Lisp, T9 map is defined as a list of pairs.

\lstset{language=lisp}
\begin{lstlisting}
(define map-T9 (list '("2" "abc") '("3" "def") '("4" "ghi") '("5" "jkl")
		     '("6" "mno") '("7" "pqrs") '("8" "tuv") '("9" "wxyz")))
\end{lstlisting}

The main searching function is implemented as the following.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (find-T9 t k) ;; return [(key value)]
  (define (accumulate-find lst child)
    (append (map-string-append (key child) (find-T9 (tree child) (string-cdr k)))
	    lst))
  (define (lookup-child lst c) ;; lst, list of childen [(key tree)], c, char
    (let ((res (find-matching-item map-T9 (lambda (x) (string=? c (car x))))))
      (if (not res) '()
	  (filter (lambda (x) (substring? (key x) (cadr res))) lst))))
  (if (string-null? k) (list (cons k (value t)))
      (fold-left accumulate-find '() (lookup-child (children t) (string-car k)))))
\end{lstlisting}

This function contains 2 inner functions. If the string is empty, the
program returns a one element list. The element is a string value pair.
For the none trivial case, the program will call inner function to
find in each child and then put them together by using fold-left high
order function.

To test this T9 search function, a very simple dictionary is
established by using Trie insertion. Then we test by calling find-T9
function on several digits sequences.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define dict-T9 (list '("home" ()) '("good" ()) '("gone" ()) '("hood" ())
		      '("a" ()) '("another" ()) '("an" ())))

(define (test-trie-T9)
  (define t (list->trie dict-T9))
  (display "find 4: ") (display (find-T9 t "4")) (newline)
  (display "find 46: ") (display (find-T9 t "46")) (newline)
  (display "find 4663: ") (display (find-T9 t "4663")) (newline)
  (display "find 2: ") (display (find-T9 t "2")) (newline)
  (display "find 22: ") (display (find-T9 t "22")) (newline))
\end{lstlisting}

Evaluate this test function will output below result.

\begin{verbatim}
find 4: ((g) (h))
find 46: ((go) (ho))
find 4663: ((gone) (good) (hood) (home))
find 2: ((a))
find 22: ()
\end{verbatim}

In order to be more space effective, Patricia can be used to replace
Trie. The search program modified as the following.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (find-T9 t k)
  (define (accumulate-find lst child)
    (append (map-string-append (key child) (find-T9 (tree child) (string- k (key child))))
	    lst))
  (define (lookup-child lst k)
    (filter (lambda (child) (string-prefix? (str->t9 (key child)) k)) lst))
  (if (string-null? k) (list (cons "" (value t)))
      (fold-left accumulate-find '() (lookup-child (children t) k))))
\end{lstlisting}

In this program a string helper function 'string-' is defined to get
the different part of two strings. It is defined like below.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (string- x y)
  (string-tail x (string-length y)))
\end{lstlisting}

Another function is 'str->t9' it will convert a alphabetic string back
to digit sequence base on T9 mapping.

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (str->t9 s)
  (define (unmap-t9 c)
    (car (find-matching-item map-T9 (lambda (x) (substring? c (cadr x))))))
  (if (string-null? s) ""
      (string-append (unmap-t9 (string-car s)) (str->t9 (string-cdr s)))))
\end{lstlisting}

We can feed the almost same test cases, and the result is output as
the following.

\begin{verbatim}
find 4: ()
find 46: ((go) (ho))
find 466: ()
find 4663: ((good) (gone) (home) (hood))
find 2: ((a))
find 22: ()
\end{verbatim}

Note the result is a bit different, the reason is described in Haskell
section. It is easy to modify the program, so that Trie and Patricia
approach give the very same result.

\section{Short summary}

In this post, we start from the Integer base trie and Patricia, the
map data structure based on integer patricia plays an important role
in Compiler implementation. Next, alphabetic Trie and Patricia are
given, and I provide a example implementation to illustrate how to
realize a predictive e-dictionary and a T9 input method. Although they
are far from the real implementation in commercial software. They show
a very simple approach of manipulating text. There are still some
interesting problem can not be solved by Trie or Patrica directly, how
ever, some other data structures such as suffix tree have close
relationship with them. I'll note something about suffix tree in other post.

\subsection{Prerequisite software}
GNU Make is used for easy build some of the program. For C++ and ANSI C programs,
GNU GCC and G++ 3.4.4 are used. I use boost triple to reduce the
amount of our code lines, boost library version I am using is
1.33.1. The path is in CXX variable in Makefile, please change it to
your path when compiling.
For Haskell programs GHC 6.10.4 is used
for building. For Python programs, Python 2.5 is used for testing, for
Scheme/Lisp program, MIT Scheme 14.9 is used.

all source files are put in one folder. Invoke 'make' or 'make all'
will build C++ and Haskell program.

Run 'make Haskell' will separate build Haskell program. There will be
two executable file generated one is htest the other is happ (with .exe
in Window like OS). Run htest will test functions in IntTrie.hs, IntPatricia.hs,
Trie.hs and Patricia.hs. Run happ will execute the editionary and T9
test cases in EDict.hs.

Run 'make cpp' will build c++ program. It will create a executable
file named cpptest (with .exe in Windows like OS). Run this program
will test inttrie.hpp, intpatricia.hpp, trie.hpp, patricia.hpp, and
edict.hpp.

Run 'make c' will build the ANSI C program for Trie. It will create a
executable file named triec (with .exe in Windows like OS).

Python programs can run directly with interpreter.

Scheme/Lisp program need be loaded into Scheme evaluator and evaluate
the final function in the program. Note that patricia.scm will hide
some functions defined in trie.scm.
