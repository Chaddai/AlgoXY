AlgoXY is a project for creating a free book about elementary
algorithms and data structures. This book doesn't only focus on
imperative (or procedural) approach but also purely functional
algorithms and data structures. It doesn't require readers to
master any programming languages, because all the algorithms are
described in math functions and pseudo codes.

For reference implementation purpose, source code in C, C++, Haskell,
Python, Scheme/Lisp are available along with the book.

The content of the book is provided under GNU FDL and the source
codes are under GNU GPLv3.

The PDF version can be downloaded from github:
